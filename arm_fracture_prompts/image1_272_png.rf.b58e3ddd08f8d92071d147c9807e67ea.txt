The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right wrist with notable evidence of a distal radius fracture, characterized by a break in the bone's continuity. Additionally, there appears to be potential dorsal angulation and displacement of the distal fragment, indicating a possible Colles' fracture pattern. Surrounding soft tissue edema may be present, and joint alignment should be assessed for any concomitant injuries in adjacent carpal bones.
