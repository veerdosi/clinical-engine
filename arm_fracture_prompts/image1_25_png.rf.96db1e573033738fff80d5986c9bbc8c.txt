The X-ray image reveals a prominent subluxation at the distal radioulnar joint, indicating possible instability. Additionally, there is an evident fracture of the scaphoid bone, characterized by cortical disruption and potential avascular necrosis risk. The alignment of the carpal bones shows malposition, which may be indicative of ligamentous injury or chronic degenerative changes.
