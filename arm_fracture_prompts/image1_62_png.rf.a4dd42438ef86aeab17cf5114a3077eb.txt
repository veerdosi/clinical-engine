The radiograph depicts the lateral view of the right hand, clearly showing the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of potential bone displacement or misalignment at the proximal interphalangeal joints, which could indicate the presence of a deformity such as a malunion or fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling surrounding the first and second digits may suggest an inflammatory response, possibly related to an underlying injury or condition affecting the tendons or ligaments.
