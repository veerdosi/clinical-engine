The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, demonstrating both the radius and ulna with a clear view of the distal ends. Notably, there is a fracture observed in the shaft of the radius, which appears to be a transverse or oblique line characterized by a loss of continuity in the bone cortex. The surrounding soft tissues show no significant edema, but the alignment of the ulna remains intact, suggesting the absence of concurrent injuries to that bone structure.
