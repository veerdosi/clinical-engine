The X-ray image depicts the right knee joint, showcasing the femur, tibia, and fibula in an extended position. There is evidence of a potential joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency around the medial compartment of the knee, which may suggest underlying pathology such as bursitis or synovitis. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation at the femoral condyles could indicate early degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
