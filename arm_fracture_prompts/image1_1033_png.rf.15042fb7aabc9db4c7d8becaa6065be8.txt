The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the distal femur and proximal tibia. There is visible joint effusion in the knee joint space and slight misalignment of the joint surfaces, which may suggest possible degenerative changes or traumatic pathology. Additionally, there are signs of osteophyte formation around the articular surfaces, indicative of potential osteoarthritis or chronic inflammation in the knee region.
