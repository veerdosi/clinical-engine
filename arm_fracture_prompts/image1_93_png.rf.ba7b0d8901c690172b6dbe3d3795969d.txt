The X-ray image of the left elbow demonstrates a potential joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency suggesting the presence of excess fluid within the joint space. There is also evidence of a possible lateral condyle fracture, characterized by a discreet irregularity along the outline of the bony prominence. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling around the joint may be noted, which could be indicative of associated trauma or inflammatory processes.
