The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, revealing the presence of metal fixation devices, indicative of surgical intervention. Notably, there is an alignment deformity of the distal radius, and the radiographic findings suggest potential osteoporotic changes in the adjacent bone structures. The metallic hardware appears to be well-positioned, with no signs of surrounding soft tissue swelling or adverse radiographic findings such as nonunion or malunion at the fracture site.
