The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a phalangeal fracture, characterized by a clear disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex and potential displacement. Additionally, there appears to be some soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which may suggest local inflammation or hematoma formation.
