The radiograph depicts an anteroposterior view of the right hand, revealing potential deformities involving multiple phalanges. There appears to be evidence of a fracture affecting the proximal phalanx of the second digit, characterized by cortical disruption and possible displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the involved areas, suggesting an underlying inflammatory response or hematoma formation.
