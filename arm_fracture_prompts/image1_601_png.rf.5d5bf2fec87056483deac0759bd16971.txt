The image presents a lateral radiograph of the right knee joint, revealing the articular surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella. Notably, there is an observable effusion, suggestive of possible joint pathology such as synovitis, which may indicate underlying inflammatory processes or trauma. Additionally, there is a potential misalignment of the patellofemoral joint, raising concerns for patellar tracking issues that could contribute to pain or instability in the knee.
