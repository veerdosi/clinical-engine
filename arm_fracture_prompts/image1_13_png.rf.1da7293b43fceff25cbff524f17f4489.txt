The image displays an X-ray of a left hand, specifically focusing on the digit distal to the metacarpals. Notable findings include significant angular deformity of the distal phalanx, suggesting the possibility of a malunion or fracture healing improperly. Additionally, there appears to be evidence of soft tissue swelling around the phalangeal joints, which may indicate underlying inflammatory changes or associated trauma.
