The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint in a flexed position, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. There is an observable displacement in the alignment of the radial head relative to the capitulum of the humerus, suggesting the possibility of a radial head subluxation or fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the joint, indicative of potential joint effusion or soft tissue injury.
