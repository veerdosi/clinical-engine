The X-ray image displays a significant fracture of the distal radius, characterized by misalignment and angulation. Internal fixation devices, including screws and plates, are visible, indicating a surgical intervention aimed at stabilizing the fracture for optimal healing. Additionally, there is notable soft tissue swelling observed around the injury site, which may indicate reactive changes associated with the fracture.
