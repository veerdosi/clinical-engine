The radiographic images display the left forearm in two different positions, illustrating the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a well-defined, transverse fracture of the mid-shaft of the radius, accompanied by signs of cortical disruption and potential angulation. Additionally, the ulna appears intact with no visible fractures, but minor soft tissue swelling may be observed in the surrounding region.
