The X-ray shows a lateral view of the elbow joint, highlighting the anatomy of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is evidence of a distal humeral fracture, characterized by a visible fracture line and significant displacement of the bone fragments. Additionally, the presence of metallic hardware suggests that surgical intervention, likely fixation, has been performed to address the fracture.
