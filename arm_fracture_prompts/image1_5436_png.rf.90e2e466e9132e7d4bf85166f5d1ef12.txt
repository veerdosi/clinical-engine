The X-ray image reveals a probable displaced fracture of the proximal humerus, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and misalignment of the bone fragments. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area may be observed, indicating potential hematoma formation or edema. Notably, there is a possible involvement of the rotator cuff tendons, which could suggest associated tendon injuries in conjunction with the fracture.
