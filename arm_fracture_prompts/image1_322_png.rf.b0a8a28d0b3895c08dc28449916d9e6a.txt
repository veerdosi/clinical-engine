The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, with clear visualization of both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a significant angulation observed in the midshaft of the radius, suggesting a possible diaphyseal fracture. Additionally, there appears to be accompanying periosteal reaction along the radius, indicative of an acute injury response.
