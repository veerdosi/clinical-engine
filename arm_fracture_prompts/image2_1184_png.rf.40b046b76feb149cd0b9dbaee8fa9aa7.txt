The image shows an oblique shoulder view with visible bone structures, particularly the humerus and scapula. There is a notable presence of a metallic fixation device, indicating a prior surgical intervention, likely related to a fracture or stabilizing a bone deformity. Additionally, there appears to be abnormal alignment of the humeral head, which may suggest an associated glenohumeral dislocation or subluxation.
