The X-ray image displays the bony structures of the hand, with a notable focus on the phalanges and metacarpals. There appears to be an irregular alignment of the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicating a potential deviation or malformation, which may suggest an underlying condition such as arthritis or a history of trauma. Additionally, osteopenic changes may be observed in the surrounding cortical and trabecular bone, highlighting a possible reduction in bone density that warrants further clinical evaluation.
