The X-ray image displays the phalangeal bones of the hand, with particular attention to the metacarpals and proximal interphalangeal joints. Notable is the presence of an osteophyte formation at the distal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate osteoarthritis in the affected digit. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, a common radiological finding associated with degenerative joint disease.
