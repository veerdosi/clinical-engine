The x-ray image displays the right hand with an emphasis on the phalangeal alignment and bone integrity. Notably, there is evidence of an angulated fracture in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, accompanied by possible surrounding edema. Additionally, the joint spaces appear preserved, but there may be signs of intra-articular involvement that require further evaluation for any potential complications.
