The X-ray image demonstrates the right forearm, including the radius and ulna, with notable cortical disruptions along the diaphysis of the radius, suggesting a potential fracture. Additionally, there is a marked displacement of the distal radius, which may indicate an acute fracture involving the wrist joint. The radiographic findings may also show signs of associated soft tissue swelling in the surrounding areas, consistent with trauma.
