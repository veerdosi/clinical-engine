The X-ray image demonstrates a transverse fracture of the distal radius, evident by the clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is associated soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggesting possible hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius appears compromised, indicating potential malalignment or displacement that may require further evaluation.
