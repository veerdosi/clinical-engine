The X-ray image presents a right elbow joint in a flexed position, displaying the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is evidence of an angular deformity characterized by a varus alignment at the elbow joint, suggesting potential osteophytic changes or abnormal biomechanical stress. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, raising suspicion of possible degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis, which may warrant further evaluation through clinical correlation.
