The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and ulna, showing the wrist joint in a lateral view. There is a visible fracture through the distal radius with possible displacement, indicating a possible instability of the fracture. The scaphoid bone is also articulating with the radius, which should be assessed for any signs of avascular necrosis or additional fractures in this area.
