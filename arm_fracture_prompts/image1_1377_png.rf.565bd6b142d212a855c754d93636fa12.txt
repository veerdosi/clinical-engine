The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, highlighting the humeral head, glenoid, and surrounding soft tissue. There is notable radiolucency in the proximal humerus, which may indicate the presence of a potential fracture or bone lesion. Additionally, the acromioclavicular joint appears to show signs of possible degenerative changes or arthropathy, characterized by irregular joint spacing and subchondral sclerosis.
