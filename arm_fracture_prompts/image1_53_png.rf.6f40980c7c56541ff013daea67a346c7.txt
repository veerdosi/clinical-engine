The image depicts a lateral radiograph of the left femur, showcasing the anatomical structure of the bone. Notable findings include a pronounced cortical discontinuity suggesting a potential fracture, with adjacent soft tissue swelling indicative of hematoma formation. The alignment of the femur appears altered, which may suggest malalignment or angulation deformities associated with traumatic injury.
