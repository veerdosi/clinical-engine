The X-ray image depicts the left wrist with a clear view of the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by irregularity in the bony cortex and a discontinuity of the bone structure. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears altered, suggesting potential displacement or malalignment related to the observed injury.
