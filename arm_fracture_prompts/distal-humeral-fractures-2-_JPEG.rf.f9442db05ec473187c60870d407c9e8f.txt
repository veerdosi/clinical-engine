The X-ray image displays a right knee joint, revealing significant joint effusion characterized by increased radiolucency surrounding the joint structures. There is evidence of potential osteophyte formation at the margins of the femoral condyles, suggesting the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the patella appears to be suboptimal, indicating possible patellar tracking issues which may contribute to joint instability.
