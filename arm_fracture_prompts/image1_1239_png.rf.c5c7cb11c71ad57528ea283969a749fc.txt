The X-ray image shows the distal femur with intramedullary fixation in place, indicated by the presence of a metallic rod and associated screws. There is evidence of a previous fracture, as suggested by the alignment and radiolucent lines around the surgical hardware, which could imply a healing process. No signs of acute complications such as hardware failure or osteomyelitis are evident in the provided view.
