The X-ray image displays the right wrist joint, revealing a notable distal radius fracture occurring in the metaphyseal region, characterized by a fracture line and potential displacement of the bone fragments. Additionally, there is evidence of decreased joint space and possible signs of osteoarthritis in the radiocarpal joint, indicating underlying degenerative changes impacting the bone and cartilage structure. Soft tissue swelling may also be observed around the wrist joint, which is commonly associated with traumatic injuries in this area.
