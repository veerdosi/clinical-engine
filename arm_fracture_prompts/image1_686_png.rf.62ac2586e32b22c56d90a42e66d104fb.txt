The image displays an X-ray of the left forearm, showing the ulna and radius in a lateral view. Notable is the presence of a visible fracture line in the mid-shaft region of the radius, indicating a diaphyseal fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, suggesting a potential inflammatory response consistent with acute trauma.
