The X-ray image clearly shows a post-surgical fixation of the left humerus, evidenced by the presence of an internal plate and screws affixed to the bone. There appears to be a healed fracture in the mid-shaft region of the humerus, indicating surgical intervention likely for fracture stabilization. The cortical bone demonstrates signs of periosteal reaction, typical in the healing phase post-fracture repair, without any visible signs of malalignment or non-union at this stage.
