The X-ray image shows the lateral view of the left forearm, including the radius and ulna. There is a notable midshaft fracture of the radius with irregular alignment and significant callus formation suggestive of a healing process. Additionally, there is evidence of potential soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate associated trauma or inflammation.
