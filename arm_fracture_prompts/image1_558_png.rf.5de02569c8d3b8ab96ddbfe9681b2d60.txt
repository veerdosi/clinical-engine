The X-ray image displays the right wrist joint, evidencing the radiographic anatomy of the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones. There is a noticeable misalignment at the wrist joint, which may suggest a potential fracture or dislocation affecting the distal radius. Additionally, soft tissue swelling could be visualized around the joint area, indicating a possible inflammatory response or hematoma formation associated with an underlying injury.
