The radiograph depicts the left shoulder region, with a clear view of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and proximal humerus. Notable in this image is the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the glenoid and humeral surfaces. Additionally, there is evidence of potential rotator cuff pathology, indicated by altered bone morphology and possible impingement on the supraspinatus tendon area.
