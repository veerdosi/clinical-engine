The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the presence of surgical hardware, specifically a plate and screws, indicative of prior orthopedic intervention. There is evidence of a previous fracture in the distal humerus, with the surrounding bone appearing to have undergone callus formation, suggestive of healing. Joint alignment appears to be acceptable; however, further assessment of the underlying soft tissues may be warranted to evaluate for any post-surgical complications such as infection or stiffness.
