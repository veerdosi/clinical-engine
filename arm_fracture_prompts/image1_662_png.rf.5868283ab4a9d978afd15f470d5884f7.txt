The radiograph presented displays an AP (anteroposterior) view of the left knee joint, demonstrating the distal femur and proximal tibia. Notably, there is evidence of osseous deformity, with irregular contour and sclerosis observed in the periarticular bone. Additionally, joint effusion may be inferred from the widening of the joint space, suggesting potential underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or reactive joint changes.
