The X-ray depicts a right forearm with a fracture evident in both the radius and ulna, specifically in the midshaft region of each bone. There are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate an associated hematoma. The alignment of the bones appears disrupted, suggesting a possible requirement for reduction to restore anatomical positioning and stability.
