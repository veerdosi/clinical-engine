The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the midshaft of the humerus, characterized by a disrupted cortical bone continuity and a notable displacement of the fracture fragments. There is also evidence of possible edema in the surrounding soft tissues, which may indicate associated contusion or hematoma. Additional assessment of the proximal and distal joints is essential to determine any potential involvement or complications.
