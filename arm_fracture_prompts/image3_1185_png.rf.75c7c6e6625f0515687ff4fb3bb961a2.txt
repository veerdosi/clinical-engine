The radiograph depicts a lateral view of the knee joint, highlighting the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula. Notable is the presence of an angular deformity at the femoral neck, which may suggest the possibility of coxa vara or other angular dysplasias. Additionally, there is a pronounced joint space narrowing that could indicate degenerative changes consistent with degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis).
