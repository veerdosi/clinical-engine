The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity at the wrist joint. There is notable dorsal angulation and possible alignment issues, indicating a potential fracture displacement. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site may be observed, suggesting an acute injury.

The second part of the image shows an intact ulna, alongside an examination of the carpal bones, where joint spaces appear preserved but the scaphoid exhibits potential signs of fracture or avascular necrosis. No signs of significant osteoarthritis or erosive changes are noted in this view. The alignment of the radial and ulnar styloids appears intact, supporting a preliminary assessment of stability in the distal radioulnar joint.
