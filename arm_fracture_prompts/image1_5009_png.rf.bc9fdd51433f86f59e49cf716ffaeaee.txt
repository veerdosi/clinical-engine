The X-ray image shows the right shoulder joint with a focus on the glenohumeral articulation. There is evidence of possible degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes. Additionally, the humeral head appears to be slightly elevated, which may indicate subacromial impingement or rotator cuff pathology.
