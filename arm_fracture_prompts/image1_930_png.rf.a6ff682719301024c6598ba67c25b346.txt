The X-ray image reveals a right elbow joint with an internal fixation device present, indicating previous surgical intervention, likely related to a fracture. There is evidence of a displaced fracture of the distal humerus, characterized by irregular alignment and the presence of metallic screws and plates that have been employed for stabilization. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema, which could suggest a post-operative inflammatory response.
