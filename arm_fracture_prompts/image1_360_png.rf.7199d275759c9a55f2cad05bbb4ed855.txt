The x-ray image depicts the right hand in an elevated position, with a clear view of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals. Notable observations include a potential fracture in the distal phalanx of the thumb, characterized by cortical disruption and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing in the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may indicate degenerative changes or inflammatory arthropathy.
