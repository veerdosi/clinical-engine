The X-ray image demonstrates the left elbow joint, with clear visualization of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a notable presence of a fracture in the proximal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue swelling indicative of possible hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the elbow joint appears compromised, suggestive of a potential dislocation or instability in the joint structure.
