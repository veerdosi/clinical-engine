The radiograph depicts an anteroposterior view of the left elbow joint, highlighting the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulnar structures. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the presence of lucency in the elbow joint space, suggesting potential inflammatory or traumatic conditions. Additionally, the imaging reveals irregularity of the articular surfaces suggestive of possible osteochondral lesions or degenerative changes within the joint.
