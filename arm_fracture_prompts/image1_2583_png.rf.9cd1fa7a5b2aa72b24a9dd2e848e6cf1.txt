The X-ray image depicts a right knee joint with an internal fixation device, suggesting a history of surgical intervention. Notable is the presence of metallic hardware, which typically indicates stabilization of a fracture, possibly involving the femur or tibia. Additionally, there is evidence of bone union around the fixation site, which may suggest healing following an osteosynthesis procedure.
