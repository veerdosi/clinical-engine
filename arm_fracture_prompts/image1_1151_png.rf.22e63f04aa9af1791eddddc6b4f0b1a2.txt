The X-ray demonstrates an abnormality localized in the proximal humerus, with potential indications of osteolytic lesions. There is significant contour alteration observed in the glenohumeral joint region, suggesting possible degenerative changes such as degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, which can indicate an inflammatory response associated with underlying pathology.
