The radiographic image presents a lateral view of the left hand, focusing on the phalangeal anatomy. Noteworthy is the presence of a possible fracture in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by cortical irregularity and changes in trabecular patterns. Additionally, there is potential soft tissue swelling evident adjacent to the affected area, which may suggest an associated contusion or inflammatory response.
