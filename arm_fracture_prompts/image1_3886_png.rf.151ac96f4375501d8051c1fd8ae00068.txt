The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, prominently displaying the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Evidence of degenerative changes is noted, characterized by subchondral sclerosis and possible joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is a visible distortion of the greater tuberosity, indicating a potential rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
