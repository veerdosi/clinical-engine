The X-ray depicts the left humeral head, which appears to exhibit signs of potential osteoarthritis characterized by subchondral sclerosis and a reduction in joint space. The presence of osteophyte formation may also be noted around the glenohumeral joint, indicating degenerative changes. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral shaft is within normal limits, with no visible fractures or dislocations evident in this view.
