The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the left hand, specifically focusing on the distal and proximal regions. There is notable angulation at the distal interphalangeal joint, suggesting possible malalignment contraindicated by possible fractures or dislocations. Additionally, the soft tissue swelling is observable around the second digit, indicating potential soft tissue injury.
