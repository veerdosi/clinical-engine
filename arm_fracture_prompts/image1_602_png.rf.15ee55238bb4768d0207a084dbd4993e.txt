The image portrays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the distal humerus, proximal radius, and proximal ulna. There is notable joint effusion evident, characterized by an increased radiolucency around the olecranon, which may suggest the presence of synovitis or inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the radiographic appearance may indicate a possible osteochondral defect or fracture, specifically in the area of the capitellum or trochlea, warranting further evaluation.
