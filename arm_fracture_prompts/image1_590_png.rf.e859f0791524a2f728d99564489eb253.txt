The X-ray image of the right wrist demonstrates the bony structures of the distal radius and ulna, as well as the carpal bones. There is a visible fracture at the distal radius, indicative of an acute injury, which may suggest a potential for displacement or misalignment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the fracture site could be noted, pointing towards underlying contusions or hematoma in the context of trauma.
