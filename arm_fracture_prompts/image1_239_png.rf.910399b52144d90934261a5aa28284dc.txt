The image presents a lateral view of the humerus, highlighting the proximal humeral region and glenohumeral joint. Notable observations include the presence of osteophytes along the glenoid margin, suggesting a degenerative joint disease, potentially osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is an alteration in the normal contour of the humeral head, which may indicate subluxation, and evaluation of the rotator cuff space reveals potential signs of tendinopathy.
