The X-ray image displays the left hand in a lateral projection, highlighting the bony anatomical structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is notable overlap of the second and third digits, which may suggest potential displacement or abnormal alignment of the finger bones. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling around the proximal interphalangeal joints could indicate possible underlying inflammatory conditions or trauma to the digits.
