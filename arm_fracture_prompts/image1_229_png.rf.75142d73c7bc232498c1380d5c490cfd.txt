The X-ray image displays a right forearm, showing both the proximal and distal regions of the radius and ulna. There is evidence of an acute fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius with moderate displacement observed, while the ulna appears intact without signs of fracture or significant deformity. Additionally, the joint spaces at both the wrist and elbow are preserved, with no signs of effusion or joint abnormalities noted in the surrounding soft tissues.
