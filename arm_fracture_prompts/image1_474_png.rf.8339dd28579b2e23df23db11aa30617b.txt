The X-ray image demonstrates a clear fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a pronounced discontinuity of the cortical bone. There is also evidence of an accompanying angular deformity at the wrist joint, suggestive of potential instability or misalignment related to the fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred surrounding the fracture site, indicating possible inflammatory response or hematoma formation.
