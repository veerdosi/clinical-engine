The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right humerus and forearm. There is a visible translational displacement at the midshaft of the radius, suggesting a possible fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the distal ulna indicates a potential ulnar variance and may require further evaluation for joint integrity.
