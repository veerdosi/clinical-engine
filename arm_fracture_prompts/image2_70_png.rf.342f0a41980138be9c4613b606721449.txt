The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, with notable alignment and joint congruity. There appears to be signs of a distal radius fracture, characterized by a disruption of the cortex and possible dorsal angulation at the fracture site. Additionally, there may be associated soft tissue swelling indicated by obscurity in the periosteal margins, suggesting an inflammatory response or hematoma formation.
