The radiograph depicts an elbow joint in the lateral view, highlighting the humerus, ulna, and radius. Notable is the presence of a potential angular deformity at the site of the elbow joint, which may suggest a condition such as cubitus valgus or varus. The joint space appears maintained, and there are no significant signs of acute fracture or dislocation evident in the visualized structures.
