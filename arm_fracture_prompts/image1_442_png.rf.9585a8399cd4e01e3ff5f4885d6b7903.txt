The X-ray image reveals a radiolucent fracture of the left ulna located approximately in its mid-shaft region. There is significant angulation and displacement of the fracture fragments, which may indicate a type of diaphyseal fracture. Surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema indicative of a possible accompanying soft tissue injury.
