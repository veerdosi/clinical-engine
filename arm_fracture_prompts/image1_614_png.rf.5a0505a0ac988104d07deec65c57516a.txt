The X-ray image reveals an apparent malalignment of the distal radius and ulna, indicative of a potential fracture or dislocation in the forearm. Notably, there is a significant angulation observed in the bony structures, suggesting possible deficiencies in bone integrity or structural compromise. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected area may indicate an associated trauma, potentially leading to complications such as hematoma formation or ligamentous injury.
