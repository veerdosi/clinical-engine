The X-ray image exhibits the proximal humerus, revealing an irregularity at the humeral head and the greater tuberosity, suggestive of possible degenerative changes or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, there is bony irregularity in the area of the acromioclavicular joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or post-traumatic changes. The joint space appears narrowed, consistent with degenerative joint disease, which could lead to limitations in range of motion and shoulder functionality.
