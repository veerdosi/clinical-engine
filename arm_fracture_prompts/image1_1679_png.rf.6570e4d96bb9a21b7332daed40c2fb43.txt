The X-ray image displays the right forearm, including the radius and ulna, showing the alignment of the long bones. There is a notable periosteal reaction along the diaphysis, which may suggest an underlying pathologic process such as an inflammatory condition or an expansive lesion. Additionally, the cortical integrity appears compromised in certain areas, indicating a potential fracture or altered bone density that warrants further investigation.
