The X-ray image reveals a well-defined spherical osseous density located at the proximal radius, suggestive of an osteochondroma. This benign bone tumor is characterized by a cartilaginous cap and may lead to a localized expansion of the cortical bone. No evidence of surrounding soft tissue involvement or distinct periosteal reaction is noted, which further indicates a non-aggressive nature of this lesion.
