The X-ray image shows the elbow joint with a clear view of the distal humerus and proximal ulna, along with the radial head. There is evidence of a possible fracture of the radial head, indicated by a disruption in the cortical outline and a potential displacement of the fragments. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion around the elbow, suggesting associated soft tissue injury or inflammation in the area.
