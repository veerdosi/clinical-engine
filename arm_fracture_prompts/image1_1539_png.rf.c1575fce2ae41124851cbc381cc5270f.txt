The X-ray image displays the glenohumeral joint, with notable signs of joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the joint capsule. There are potential osseous irregularities in the proximal humerus, suggesting possible rotator cuff pathologies such as tears or tendinopathy. Additionally, there is a discernible reduction in subacromial space, which may be indicative of impingement syndrome or related degenerative changes in the shoulder region.
