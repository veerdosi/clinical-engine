The X-ray image displays the left arm, highlighting the humerus and proximal radius, which appears to have a significant cortical disruption suggestive of a fracture. There is an abnormal angulation noted at the mid-shaft area, consistent with a possible malalignment from a previous or acute injury. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating potential hematoma formation or inflammatory response.
