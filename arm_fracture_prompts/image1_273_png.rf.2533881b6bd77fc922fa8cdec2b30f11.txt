The X-ray image shows an oblique fracture of the mid-shaft of the right radius, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is also evidence of accompanying soft tissue swelling, which may suggest a potential hematoma formation adjacent to the fracture site. The alignment of the distal fragments appears to be angulated, warranting further evaluation for potential neurovascular compromise in the area.
