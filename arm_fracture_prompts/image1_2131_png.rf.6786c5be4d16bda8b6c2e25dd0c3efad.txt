The image presents an X-ray of the left wrist, demonstrating a surgical fixation device, specifically a plate and screws, applied to the distal radius. There is evidence of comminuted fracture characteristics of the distal radius, indicated by the alignment of the fixation hardware. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted, suggesting an inflammatory response associated with the injury and subsequent surgical intervention.
