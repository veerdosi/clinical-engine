The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left shoulder, exhibiting the anatomy of the humerus and the glenohumeral joint. Notably, there is the presence of metallic hardware, indicating a previous surgical intervention, likely for stabilization or repair of the shoulder joint structures. The soft tissues around the shoulder appear intact, with no obvious signs of acute fracture or dislocation evident in this projection.
