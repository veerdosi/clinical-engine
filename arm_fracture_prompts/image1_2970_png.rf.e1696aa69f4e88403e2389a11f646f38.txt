The X-ray demonstrates a left humerus with evidence of an oblique fracture in the mid-shaft region, characterized by a distinct fracture line indicating cortical disruption. There is also notable callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process is underway. Additionally, the presence of intramedullary hardware is observed, likely indicative of previous surgical intervention aimed at stabilizing the fracture.
