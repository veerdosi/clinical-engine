The X-ray image depicts the knee joint, specifically focusing on the femur and tibia with notable alignment. Mild joint effusion may be evident, indicated by increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar area, suggesting possible synovitis or intra-articular pathology. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation around the joint surfaces points toward degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
