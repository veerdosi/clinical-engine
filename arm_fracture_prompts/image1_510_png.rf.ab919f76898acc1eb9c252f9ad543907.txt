The X-ray image of the right forearm shows the radius and ulna in a lateral view. Notably, there is a visible fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and potential dislocation of the radial styloid. The surrounding soft tissues appear normal without any evident signs of edema or acute traumatic injury.
