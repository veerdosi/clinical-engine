The X-ray images depict the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones of the wrist. Notable observations include a potential fracture or malalignment in the distal radius, which may indicate an acute injury. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, suggesting an inflammatory process that may be associated with trauma or underlying pathology.
