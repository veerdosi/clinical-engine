The X-ray image reveals a right shoulder with evidence of surgical intervention, including the presence of a metallic fixation device, indicative of previous fracture management. There is also notable callus formation around the distal humerus, suggesting a healing process following a fracture, likely in the humeral head or surgical neck area. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed in the surrounding soft structures, which could point to postoperative changes or possible inflammation.
