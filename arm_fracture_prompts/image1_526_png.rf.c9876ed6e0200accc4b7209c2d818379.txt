The X-ray depicts the left forearm, showcasing the radius and ulna with a notable fracture through the midshaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and a lack of continuity. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest associated hematoma or inflammation. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating potential angular or rotational deformity in the affected limb.
