The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the right lower leg, revealing the tibia and fibula bones. Notably, there is evidence of a transverse fracture in the mid-diaphysis of the tibia, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity. The fibula appears intact without any visible fractures, but the surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, corresponding with the acute nature of the injury.
