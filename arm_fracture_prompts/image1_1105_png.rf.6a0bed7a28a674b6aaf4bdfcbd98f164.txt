The X-ray image of the wrist displays an acute fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a visible disruption in the cortical margin. Additionally, there is significant angulation of the fractured fragments, which may indicate potential instability in the wrist joint. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the area, suggesting associated contusion or hematoma formation.
