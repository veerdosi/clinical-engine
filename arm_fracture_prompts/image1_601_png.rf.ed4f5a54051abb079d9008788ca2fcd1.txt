The image presents a right knee joint X-ray, displaying typical anatomical structures including the femur, tibia, and patella. Notable is a visible joint effusion, evidenced by increased translucency in the suprapatellar region, which may indicate an underlying inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, suggesting possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis or other arthritic conditions.
