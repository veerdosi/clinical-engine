The X-ray image reveals multiple carpal bones of the right wrist, including the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum, with an appropriate alignment of the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of potential osseous pathology, manifesting as a noticeable fracture line in the distal radius, suggestive of a possible fracture depending on the surrounding soft tissue implications. The visualized joint spaces appear intact, but any presence of osteopenia or signs of degenerative joint disease cannot be assessed without further clinical correlation.
