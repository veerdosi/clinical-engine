The x-ray image presented shows the right hand in a lateral view, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpal bones. There is evidence of deformity in the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may suggest conditions such as osteoarthritis or possible subluxation. Additionally, the bone density appears relatively normal, but any notable abnormalities in the joint spaces may require further evaluation for degenerative changes or inflammatory processes.
