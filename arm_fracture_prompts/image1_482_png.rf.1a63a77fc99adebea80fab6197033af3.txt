The X-ray image depicts the elbow joint, showcasing normal anatomy including the distal humerus, proximal radius, and olecranon process of the ulna. Notably, there are signs of a possible joint effusion indicated by increased radiolucency around the capitulum and radial head. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna suggests a potential deformity, with the possibility of cubitus varus as evidenced by the angle formed at the elbow joint.
