The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the knee joint, revealing the distal femur and proximal tibia, as well as the patella. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by a mild decrease in fat pad clarity surrounding the patella, suggestive of potential inflammatory pathology or traumatic joint involvement. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes around the knee joint suggests the development of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis evident in the radiographic depiction.
