The X-ray image of the right wrist reveals a surgical implant, specifically a plate and screws, indicating prior surgical intervention likely related to an orthopedic condition. There is visible disruption of the cortical bone in the distal radius, suggesting a previous fracture which has been surgically stabilized. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no signs of acute inflammatory changes observable in the visualized area.
