The provided X-ray image depicts the glenohumeral joint, demonstrating the anatomical relationship between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There is an observable disruption in the smooth contour of the proximal humerus, raising suspicion for a possible humeral head deformity. Additionally, there is evidence of a possible joint effusion indicated by the soft tissue swelling around the shoulder, which may suggest underlying pathology such as impingement or rotator cuff pathology.
