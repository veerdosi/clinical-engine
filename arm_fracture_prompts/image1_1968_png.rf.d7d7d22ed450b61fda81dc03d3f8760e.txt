The X-ray demonstrates the bones of the right hand, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal structures. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the phalanges exhibit irregular cortical margins, indicative of possible prior trauma or an underlying degenerative process.
