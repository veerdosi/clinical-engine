The X-ray image displays the right hand in an anteroposterior view, focusing on the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is a fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical outline and possible angulation. The surrounding soft tissue shows no significant signs of swelling or gas formation, but there may be subtle evidence of edema at the fracture site.
