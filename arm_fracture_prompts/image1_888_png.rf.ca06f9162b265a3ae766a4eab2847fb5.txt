The radiograph displays a lateral view of the forearm, illustrating both the radius and ulna bones. Notable in the image is a pronounced callus formation at the midshaft of the ulna, suggesting a history of fracture healing. Additionally, there are areas of cortical thickening along the ulna, which may indicate previous trauma or underlying stress conditions affecting bone integrity.
