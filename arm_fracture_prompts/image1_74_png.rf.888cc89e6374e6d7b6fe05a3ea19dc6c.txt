The X-ray image reveals an acute fracture of the distal humerus, characterized by a displacement of the fracture fragments. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected area, which may suggest an associated hematoma. Notably, the joint alignment appears compromised, indicating potential involvement of the elbow joint structure.
