The provided X-ray images of the left wrist demonstrate multiple significant findings. The first image indicates the presence of a comminuted fracture of the distal radius with irregular fragmentations observed distal to the radial metaphysis. Additionally, in the second image, there is evident dorsal angulation of the distal fragment, suggesting potential instability in the fracture.

In the third image, there is a suggestion of associated soft tissue swelling, indicating possible hematoma formation surrounding the fracture site. Furthermore, signs of early malunion may be present due to the altered alignment of the carpal bones relative to the radius. Overall, these images collectively suggest an acute traumatic injury that necessitates further clinical evaluation and management.
