The X-ray image shows an anterior view of the left shoulder, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures. There is evident joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis affecting the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Additionally, the acromioclavicular joint appears unremarkable; however, any irregularities should be assessed for potential degenerative changes or impingement syndromes in the surrounding soft tissues.
