The X-ray image displayed is of the right forearm, clearly showing the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortex and potential displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling can be observed adjacent to the fracture site, indicating possible traumatic injury or associated soft tissue damage.
