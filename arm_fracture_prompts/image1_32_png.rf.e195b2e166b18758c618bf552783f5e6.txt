The X-ray image presented demonstrates an anterior-posterior view of the wrist, revealing the distal radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of an apparent distal radial fracture with dorsal angulation, indicating a possible fracture through the metaphysis. Additionally, there may be evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which can be reflective of adjacent periosteal reaction or hematoma formation.
