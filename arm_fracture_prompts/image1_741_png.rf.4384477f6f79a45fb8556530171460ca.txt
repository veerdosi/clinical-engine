The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the left knee joint, highlighting the femur, patella, and tibia. Notably, there appears to be a periarticular effusion indicated by the presence of a joint swelling, which is often suggestive of inflammatory processes or trauma. Additionally, there may be evidence of a fracture line involving the femoral condyle or the tibial plateau, which could indicate an acute injury requiring further evaluation.
