The x-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, showcasing the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Notable is the presence of an osteosynthetic device, which suggests a history of surgical intervention, potentially for a previous fracture or instability in the proximal humerus. Additionally, evidence of joint effusion may be present, indicating possible inflammation or degenerative changes within the shoulder joint complex.
