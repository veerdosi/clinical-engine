The x-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna in an anteroposterior view, with notable enlargement and irregularity at the distal metaphysis of the radius, suggestive of a possible pathological process. There is a visible fracture line in the radial shaft, which may indicate an acute fracture or potential avulsion injury, particularly at the wrist joint level. Additionally, the carpal bones appear well-aligned, but further assessment is warranted to evaluate for signs of soft tissue edema or other associated injuries.
