The X-ray image demonstrates the right hand in an extended position, allowing for visualization of the phalangeal bones. There is a notable displacement in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, suggesting a possible fracture and subsequent misalignment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling can be inferred around the affected area, indicating a potential inflammatory process associated with trauma.
