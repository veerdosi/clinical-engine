The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the diaphysis of the radius, evidenced by a disruption in cortical continuity and potential displacement. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no signs of fracture or dislocation in the wrist region.
