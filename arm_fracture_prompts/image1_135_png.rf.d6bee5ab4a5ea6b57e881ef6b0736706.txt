The X-ray image presents a clear view of the left forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna in a linear alignment. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a distinct break in cortical bone integrity. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, demonstrating no acute signs of edema or hematoma.
