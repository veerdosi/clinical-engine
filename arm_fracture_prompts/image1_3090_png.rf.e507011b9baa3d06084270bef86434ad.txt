The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left forearm, showcasing an anatomical configuration that suggests an osteosynthesis procedure involving the distal radius and ulna. Notable metallic fixation devices, including screws and plates, are observed in the region, indicating a prior surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Additionally, there may be signs of callus formation around the fracture site, indicative of the healing process post-fracture repair.
