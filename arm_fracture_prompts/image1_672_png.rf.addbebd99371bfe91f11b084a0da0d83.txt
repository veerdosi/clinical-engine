The X-ray image displays an apparent alteration in the normal anatomical alignment of the elbow joint, indicating possible degenerative changes or abnormal deformity. Notably, there is a distinct curvature of the humerus, which may suggest conditions such as cubitus varus or valgus. Additionally, the presence of joint space narrowing could reflect underlying osteoarthritis or other inflammatory processes affecting the synovial structures.
