The X-ray image shows an oblique fracture of the humerus, characterized by a diagonal break through the shaft of the bone, with a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate a hematoma formation. Additionally, a metallic foreign body is visible, potentially complicating the assessment of the injury and necessitating further evaluation for any associated injuries or complications.
