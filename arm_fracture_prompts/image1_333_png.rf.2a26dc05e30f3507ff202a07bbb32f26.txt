The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the humerus, ulna, and radius, highlighting the elbow joint. Notably, there is a visible fracture line near the distal end of the humerus, suggesting a potential humeral fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears to be compromised, indicative of possible ulnar displacement or malalignment in relation to the humerus.
