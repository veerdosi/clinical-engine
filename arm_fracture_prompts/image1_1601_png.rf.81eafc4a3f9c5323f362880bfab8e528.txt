The X-ray presents a lateral view of the left elbow joint, showcasing a prominent radiolucent outline suggesting the presence of a foreign body located in the soft tissues adjacent to the distal humerus. There is evidence of potential soft tissue swelling or edema around the region, indicating an underlying inflammatory response. Additionally, the bone cortex appears intact, with no visible fractures or dislocations, which may suggest a foreign body or other abnormality affecting the surrounding structures rather than direct osseous involvement.
