The X-ray image displays the right forearm, encompassing both the radius and ulna. There is observable cortical disruption and a potential fracture line through the mid-shaft of the ulna, indicative of a possible ulna shaft fracture. The alignment of the distal radius appears to be maintained, with no significant displacement noted in this view, suggesting a stable fracture pattern in the ulna.
