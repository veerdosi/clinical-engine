The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna bones. There is no evident fracture or acute pathology observed within the shaft of either bone; however, slight changes in the cortical bone may warrant further investigation for possible stress reactions or early signs of bone pathology. The joint space at the proximal and distal ends appears normal, indicating no signs of joint effusion or degenerative changes.
