The X-ray image of the right arm reveals a notable angulated fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement of the fracture site. Additionally, the imaging demonstrates soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture, indicating possible contusion or hematoma formation. The elbow joint appears intact, but there may be subtle joint effusion present, warranting further evaluation for potential associated injuries.
