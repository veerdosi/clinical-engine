The X-ray image depicts the left humerus and forearm bones, showing an alignment that is consistent with a normal anatomical structure. However, there is a noticeable radiolucency suggesting possible osteolytic lesions in the distal region of the radius and ulna. The joint spaces appear well-defined, but any irregularity at the elbow joint may indicate potential joint effusion or underlying pathology that warrants further investigation.
