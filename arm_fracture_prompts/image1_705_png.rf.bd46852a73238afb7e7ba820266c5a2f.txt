The X-ray image displays the left humerus and forearm bones, including the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone and possible displacement of fracture fragments. The alignment of the associated joints, including the elbow and wrist, appears intact, indicating that articular surfaces are likely unaffected by this injury.
