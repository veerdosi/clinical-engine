The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a notable fracture line present in the olecranon process of the ulna, indicating a potential acute traumatic injury. Surrounding soft tissue edema may be visible, suggesting concomitant soft tissue injury that often accompanies fractures in the elbow region.
