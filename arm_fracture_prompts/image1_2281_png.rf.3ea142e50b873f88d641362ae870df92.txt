The X-ray image displays the right hand with identifiable bony structures, revealing a presence of metallic hardware, indicative of surgical intervention or fixation. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, and the alignment of the carpal bones may be affected due to the injury.
