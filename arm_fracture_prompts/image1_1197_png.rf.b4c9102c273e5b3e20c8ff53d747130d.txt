The X-ray image depicts the right forearm with an emphasis on the distal radius and ulna. Notable findings include a potential fracture or malalignment in the distal radius, which may indicate trauma or stress-related changes in the bone structure. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, suggesting possible capsular involvement or inflammation.
