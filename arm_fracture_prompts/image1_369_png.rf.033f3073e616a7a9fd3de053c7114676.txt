The X-ray image displays an elongated humerus and an abnormal curvature of the forearm bones, indicating possible deformity. Notable is the presence of an angulated fracture seen in the mid-shaft of the radius, accompanied by periosteal reaction, which may suggest recent trauma. Additionally, the joint spaces appear to be maintained, with no evidence of degenerative changes or acute dislocation in the elbow region.
