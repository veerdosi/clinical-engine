The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral articulation. There is evidence of an avulsion fracture at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, characterized by a distinct separation of the fragment from the main bone structure. Additionally, there is a subtle increase in the joint space, which may suggest associated soft tissue injury or effusion.
