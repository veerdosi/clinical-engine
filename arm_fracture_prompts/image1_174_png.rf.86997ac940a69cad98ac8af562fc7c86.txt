The X-ray image depicts the left hand, showcasing the phalangeal bones of the fingers. There is a notable absence of any acute fractures, but the appearance of the distal phalanges may suggest some degenerative changes, possibly indicative of osteoarthritis. Joint spaces appear symmetrically well-maintained, and no signs of subluxation or dislocation are evident in the metacarpophalangeal joints.
