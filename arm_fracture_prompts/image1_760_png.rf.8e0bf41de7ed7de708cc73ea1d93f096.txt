The X-ray image displays the right knee joint in a standard anterior-posterior view, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula in alignment. Notable is the presence of joint space narrowing, which may indicate osteoarthritis affecting the medial compartment of the knee. Additionally, there are signs of potential osteophyte formation around the patellofemoral joint, suggesting degenerative changes commonly associated with chronic wear and tear on the joint surfaces.
