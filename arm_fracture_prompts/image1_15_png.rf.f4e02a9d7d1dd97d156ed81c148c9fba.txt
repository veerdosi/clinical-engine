The image presents an X-ray of the forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna in a lateral view. Notably, there is evidence of a diaphyseal fracture of the shaft of the radius, characterized by a visible fracture line and surrounding soft tissue edema. The ulna appears intact, with no signs of displacement or other acute pathology noted in this region.
