The X-ray image reveals the left humerus, which shows the presence of an intramedullary nail fixed with multiple screws for stabilization, indicating surgical intervention likely due to a fracture. There is evidence of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process is underway. No signs of malalignment or non-union are observed in the bone structure depicted.
