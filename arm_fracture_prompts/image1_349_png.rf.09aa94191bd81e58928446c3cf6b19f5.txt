The X-ray image shows the left shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and proximal humerus. There is a notable joint space narrowing observed at the glenohumeral joint, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis or other degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the bony contours appear irregular, potentially indicating the presence of osteophytes or subchondral sclerosis, which are common findings in chronic joint conditions.
