The image presents an X-ray of the right elbow joint, showcasing the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulnar structure. Notably, there is the presence of radiolucency in the region of the olecranon, which may indicate osteolytic lesions or other pathological changes such as rheumatoid arthritis or a previous fracture. The joint space appears well-preserved, but sclerosis around the articulating surfaces could suggest underlying degenerative changes or localized bone pathology.
