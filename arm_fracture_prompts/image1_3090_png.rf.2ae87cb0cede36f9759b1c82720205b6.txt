The X-ray displays a left wrist with a notable fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement and comminution. Surgical intervention is apparent, as evidenced by the presence of surgical hardware, including a plate and screws, which indicates previous fixation of the fracture. The alignment of the carpal bones appears preserved, but there may be associated soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site.
