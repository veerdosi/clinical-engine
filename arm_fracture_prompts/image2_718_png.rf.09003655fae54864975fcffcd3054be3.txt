The image depicts a radiograph of the right forearm, clearly showing both the radius and ulna. There is an observable distal radius fracture characterized by a transverse line across the bone, indicating a possible fracture type that often represents a break resulting from trauma. Additionally, there is significant soft tissue swelling noted surrounding the fracture site, which could suggest an acute inflammatory response associated with the injury.
