The X-ray image reveals a left shoulder with observable changes around the humeral head, suggesting potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. There is a noticeable joint space narrowing, which may indicate a loss of cartilage and reactive changes in the adjacent bony structures. Additionally, slight bone spurring could be present, contributing to impingement or restrictions in range of motion, commonly associated with degenerative shoulder conditions.
