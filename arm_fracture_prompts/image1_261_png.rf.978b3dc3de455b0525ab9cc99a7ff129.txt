The X-ray image depicts significant deformity in the wrist region, characterized by altered alignment of the carpal bones and abnormal joint spacing. Notably, there appears to be evidence of osteoarthritis, with joint space narrowing and possible osteophyte formation seen around the distal radioulnar joint. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis suggests chronic changes associated with joint degeneration in the carpal and distal radius areas.
