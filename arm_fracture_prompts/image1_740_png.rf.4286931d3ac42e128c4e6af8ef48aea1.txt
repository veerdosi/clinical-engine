The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the right forearm, demonstrating angulation and localized swelling near the mid-shaft of the radius, suggestive of a fracture. There appears to be cortical disruption along the radius, indicating a possible compound fracture, with adjacent soft tissue swelling consistent with associated hematoma formation. Additionally, the ulna remains intact, though further imaging may be necessary to assess for potential concurrent injuries.
