The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the proximal humerus and the elbow joint, highlighting potential abnormalities in skeletal alignment. Notable is the presence of a malalignment of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity, suggestive of possible shoulder dislocation or subluxation. Furthermore, there is evidence of an abnormal curvature of the humerus, which may indicate underlying deformity such as a fracture or developmental dysplasia.
