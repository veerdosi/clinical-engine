The provided radiographic image displays the right hand in an anteroposterior view, with particular emphasis on the metacarpals and proximal phalanges.

Additionally, there are subtle signs of periarticular osteophyte formation, suggestive of chronic degenerative joint disease affecting the digit joints.
