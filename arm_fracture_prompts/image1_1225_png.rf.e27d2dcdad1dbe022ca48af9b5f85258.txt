The image illustrates a left wrist X-ray demonstrating an apparent fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortical bone continuity seen at the distal end. Additionally, there is a noticeable radial deviation of the wrist, suggesting possible displacement associated with the fracture. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no evident signs of osteoarthritic changes or significant bone pathology observed in the other structures.
