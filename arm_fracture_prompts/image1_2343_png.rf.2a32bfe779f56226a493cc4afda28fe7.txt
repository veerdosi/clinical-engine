The X-ray image displays the left tibia and fibula, with an observable angulation indicative of a possible fracture. There is localized cortical disruption at the site of the fracture, with accompanying periosteal reaction suggestive of an acute injury. Additionally, the alignment of the bone structures appears compromised, raising concerns for potential instability in the affected region.
