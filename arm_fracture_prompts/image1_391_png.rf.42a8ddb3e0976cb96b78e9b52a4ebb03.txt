The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the hand, revealing the distal phalanges and proximal phalanges of digits two and three. Notably, there is evidence of a bony abnormality at the second proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting possible deformity indicative of a condition such as osteoarthritis or a previous injury. The joint space narrowing and presence of osteophytes in the affected area could further support the diagnosis of degenerative joint disease, which may manifest as pain and limited range of motion.
