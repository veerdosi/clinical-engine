The imaging demonstrates a significant angular deformity of the distal femur, indicative of possible genu varum (bowleg deformity). There is notable widening of the intercondylar notch and associated irregularity at the joint surfaces, which may suggest underlying osteoarthritis or a prior injury. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is observed, indicating increased stress on the articular surfaces.
