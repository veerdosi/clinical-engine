The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint with potential signs of glenohumeral joint pathology. Notably, there is a lack of clear delineation of the articular surfaces, which may suggest the presence of degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, there is an observation of possible soft tissue swelling or edema around the joint area, further indicating an inflammatory process or trauma.
