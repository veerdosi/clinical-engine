The X-ray image depicts a right shoulder in an anteroposterior view, revealing the presence of a humeral head displacement indicative of a possible shoulder dislocation. There is also evident degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, suggestive of osteoarthritis. Further assessment of the acromioclavicular joint may be warranted, as mild changes consistent with acromioclavicular joint arthritis can also be visualized.
