The X-ray reveals an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and a visible fracture line. Notably, there is soft tissue swelling surrounding the area, suggesting associated contusions or hematoma formation. Additionally, no signs of joint dislocation are evident in the metacarpophalangeal joint region, which appears congruent.
