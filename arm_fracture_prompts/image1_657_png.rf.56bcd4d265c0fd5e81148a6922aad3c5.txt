The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the right shoulder, revealing the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity. Notably, there is a potential dislocation or significant subluxation of the shoulder joint, indicated by the position of the humeral head relative to the glenoid. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit signs of edema, which may suggest an inflammatory process or trauma affecting the shoulder joint complex.
