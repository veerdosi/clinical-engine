The X-ray depicts an imaging of the humerus, showing a notable deformity of the distal end at the elbow joint. There is evidence of irregular bony contour and altered joint space suggestive of an arthritic process, which may indicate degenerative joint disease. Additionally, signs of possible osteochondral changes are visible, which could represent an underlying pathology affecting the cartilage and subchondral bone.
