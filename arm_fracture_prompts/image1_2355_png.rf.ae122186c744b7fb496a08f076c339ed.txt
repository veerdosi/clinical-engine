The X-ray image displays the left wrist and hand, illustrating the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notably, there is evidence of possible osseous deformities at the distal aspect of the radius, which may indicate a fracture or other bony irregularity. Additionally, signs of joint space narrowing and possible soft tissue swelling can be observed, suggesting underlying inflammatory or degenerative processes affecting the wrist.
