The radiographic series of the left wrist reveals an irregular joint space, particularly at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints, indicative of potential degenerative joint disease or inflammatory arthropathy. Notably, there is the presence of osteophytes along the edges of the carpals, suggesting chronic joint changes that may contribute to functional impairment. The alignment of the distal radius appears altered, which could be consistent with a post-traumatic deformity or malunion, warranting further clinical correlation.
