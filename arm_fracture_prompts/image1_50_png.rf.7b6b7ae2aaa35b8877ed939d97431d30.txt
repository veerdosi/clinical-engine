The X-ray of the forearm reveals a noticeable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a transverse mid-shaft break. Additionally, there appears to be some angular deformity along the ulnar aspect of the limb, indicating a possible malalignment in conjunction with the fracture. Edema may be present in the surrounding soft tissues, suggesting associated trauma and inflammation in the region of the injury.
