The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the midshaft of the radius, characterized by angulation and displacement of the bone fragments. Notably, there is a presence of a metallic fixation device adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting prior surgical intervention for stabilization. Surrounding soft tissues show signs of potential swelling or hematoma, indicative of trauma associated with the fracture.
