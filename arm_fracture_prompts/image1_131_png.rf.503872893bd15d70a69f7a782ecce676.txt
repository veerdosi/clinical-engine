The X-ray image reveals the elbow joint in a flexed position, with clear visibility of the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notably, there is a presence of an abnormal bony prominence at the lateral aspect of the joint, suggesting the possibility of an olecranon spur or calcific deposition. Additionally, there are indications of joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation, which may be suggestive of degenerative changes or osteoarthritis affecting the elbow joint.
