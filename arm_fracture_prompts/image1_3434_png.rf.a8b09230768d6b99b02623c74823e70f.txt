The X-ray reveals a left knee joint with notable joint effusion and signs of osteophytic changes at the margins, indicative of osteoarthritis. There are also signs of potential chondromalacia observed in the patellar region, characterized by a loss of cartilage density. Additionally, the alignment of the femur and tibia appears abnormal, suggesting possible malalignment or varus/valgus deformity within the knee joint.
