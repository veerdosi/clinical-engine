The X-ray image demonstrates a significant radiolucency in the proximal humerus, suggestive of a potential pathological process such as a bone cyst or tumor. There is also an apparent disruption in the cortical integrity of the humeral head, which may indicate a possible fracture or osteolytic lesion. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted adjacent to the affected area, raising concerns for underlying inflammatory or infectious processes.
