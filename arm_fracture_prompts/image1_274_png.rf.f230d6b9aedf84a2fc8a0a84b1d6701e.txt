The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, clearly showing both the radius and ulna bones. Notable radiographic features include an abnormal angulation of the radius suggesting possible malalignment or a deformity in bone structure. Additionally, there is an observed increase in radiolucency in areas of the bone, which may indicate osteopenia or a potential underlying pathologic process affecting bone density.
