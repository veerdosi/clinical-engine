The X-ray image demonstrates a left shoulder joint, prominently displaying the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. Notably, there is evidence of sub-acromial space narrowing, which may indicate significant rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes at the acromion suggests degenerative changes consistent with shoulder osteoarthritis.
