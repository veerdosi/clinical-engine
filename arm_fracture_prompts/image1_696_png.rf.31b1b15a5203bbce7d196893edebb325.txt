The X-ray image depicts the left humerus in a lateral view, revealing cortical bone continuity throughout the diaphysis. There is a notable presence of a well-defined, radiolucent lesion in the mid-shaft region, which may indicate a pathological process, such as osteolytic activity associated with an underlying neoplasm or infection. Additionally, the periosteal reaction appears to be heightened, suggesting a possible inflammatory response or reactive bone formation secondary to the identified lesion.
