The x-ray image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, highlighting both the humerus and the ulna as they articulate at the elbow. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency within the joint space, which may suggest an inflammatory process or trauma. Furthermore, there are signs of potential osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, possibly indicating the presence of osteoarthritis or a degenerative condition affecting the elbow.
