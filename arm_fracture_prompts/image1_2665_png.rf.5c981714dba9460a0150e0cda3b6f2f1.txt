The X-ray image demonstrates a right shoulder joint with a clear view of the glenohumeral joint and the proximal humerus. There is evidence of a possible rotator cuff tear indicated by the presence of abnormal shadowing in the supraspinatus region and potential fluid accumulation in the subacromial space. Additionally, signs of degenerative joint disease may be suggested by the presence of osteophytes along the glenoid rim, which could indicate glenohumeral arthrosis.
