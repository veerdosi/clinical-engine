The X-ray image shows a left humerus exhibiting signs of a mid-shaft fracture characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is associated soft tissue swelling indicated by the surrounding radiolucent area, which may suggest hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the fracture fragments appears to be significantly displaced, warranting further evaluation for potential nerve or vascular compromise.
