The X-ray image presents the left shoulder and upper arm, revealing a potential proximal humeral fracture with displacement observed in the humeral head. There is an abnormal alignment of the humerus suggesting subluxation or compromised joint integrity at the glenohumeral joint. Additionally, adjacent soft tissue swelling may indicate the presence of hematoma or inflammation secondary to the underlying condition.
