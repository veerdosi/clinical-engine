The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the distal humerus, showing a distinct fracture line through the mid-diaphysis. Additionally, there is evidence of an angular deformity of the elbow joint, suggestive of malalignment and potential instability. The surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema, indicating possible associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
