The X-ray image demonstrates a notable osteolytic lesion located in the proximal humerus, suggesting possible pathological involvement. Surrounding the lesion, there is evidence of cortical thinning, which may indicate underlying bone resorption or fragility. Additionally, the overall alignment of the humerus appears normal, but close examination of the periosteum may be warranted to assess for any signs of periostitis or reactive changes.
