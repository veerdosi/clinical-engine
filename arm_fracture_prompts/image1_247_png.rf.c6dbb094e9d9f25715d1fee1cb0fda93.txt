The X-ray reveals an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx in the fifth digit, characterized by a distinct fracture line and associated periosteal reaction. There is also an observable misalignment at the fracture site, indicating potential displacement. No signs of osteomyelitis or other underlying bone pathologies are visualized in the surrounding tissues.
