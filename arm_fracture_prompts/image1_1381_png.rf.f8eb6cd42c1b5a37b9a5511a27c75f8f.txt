The X-ray image demonstrates an apparent dislocation of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, characterized by the separation of the clavicle from the acromion of the scapula. There are signs of potential bone irregularities, possibly indicating the presence of osteophyte formation at the glenohumeral joint. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral head appears compromised, which may suggest associated rotator cuff pathology or subacromial impingement.
