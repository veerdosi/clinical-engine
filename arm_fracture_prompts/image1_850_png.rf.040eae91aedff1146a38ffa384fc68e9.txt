The x-ray image displays an overview of the right shoulder joint, showing the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notable in this image is the presence of a radiopaque lesion located adjacent to the humeral head, which may suggest the possibility of an underlying pathological process. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing and potential subacromial bursal involvement, indicating possible rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
