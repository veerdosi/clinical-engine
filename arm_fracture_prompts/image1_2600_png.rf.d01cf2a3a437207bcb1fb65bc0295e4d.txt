The X-ray reveals an apparent fracture of the distal radius characterized by a transverse line across the bone. There is also evidence of possible dorsal angulation and a notable displacement at the fracture site, suggesting a potential instability in the distal radioulnar joint. Surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of swelling or hematoma, indicating an acute inflammatory response associated with the injury.
