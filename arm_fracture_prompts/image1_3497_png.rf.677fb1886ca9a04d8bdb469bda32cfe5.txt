The X-ray image reveals a significant deformity in the wrist, specifically indicative of a fracture in the distal radius, presenting as dorsal angulation. Additionally, the image shows signs of an intra-articular fracture affecting the wrist joint, which may complicate joint mechanics and healing. There is also evidence of surgical fixation hardware present, suggesting prior operative intervention to stabilize the fracture and promote healing.
