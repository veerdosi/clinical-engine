The X-ray image of the right hand displays the phalangeal and metacarpal bones, showing well-defined cortical outlines and trabecular patterns. There is an observable deformity characterized by a pronounced malalignment of the proximal phalanx of the index finger, indicative of a potential displacement. Additionally, signs of joint space narrowing are evident at the metacarpophalangeal joints, suggesting the presence of degenerative changes or arthritis.
