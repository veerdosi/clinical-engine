The X-ray image displays the right wrist joint, showcasing the carpal bones, particularly the scaphoid and lunate, which are crucial for wrist mobility. Notably, there is an observable fracture line in the scaphoid bone, indicative of a possible acute injury that can lead to avascular necrosis if not properly managed. Additionally, joint space narrowing is evident, suggesting potential osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes affecting the articular surfaces of the distal radius and ulnar styloid.
