The X-ray image displays an elongated view of the right forearm, including both the radius and ulna bones. Notable findings include a marked cortical disruption of the midshaft radius, suggestive of an acute fracture with potential displacement. The ulna appears intact without any visible signs of fractures or deformities, and surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable.
