The X-ray image reveals a likely proximal humeral fracture, characterized by a distinct disruption in the continuity of the humeral neck and the greater tuberosity. Additionally, the presence of orthopedic hardware, indicated by the metallic implant, suggests prior surgical intervention, possibly for fracture stabilization or reconstruction. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no evident signs of acute pathologies such as edema or hematoma in the adjacent areas.
