The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint, revealing a potential joint effusion characterized by increased radiolucency surrounding the olecranon fossa. There is evidence of cortical disruption suggestive of a possible fracture in the distal humerus or proximal ulna. Additionally, the alignment of the articular surfaces appears affected, indicating potential post-traumatic or degenerative changes in the joint architecture.
