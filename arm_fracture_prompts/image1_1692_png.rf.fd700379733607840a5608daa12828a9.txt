The x-ray depicts an anteroposterior view of the distal femur and proximal tibia, with significant bony irregularities noted around the joint space. There is evidence of an osteolytic lesion in the proximal fibula, which may indicate underlying pathology such as a bone tumor or infection. Additionally, there appears to be joint effusion in the knee, which may suggest inflammatory or traumatic processes affecting the surrounding soft tissues.
