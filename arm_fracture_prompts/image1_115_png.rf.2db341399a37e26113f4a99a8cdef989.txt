The image presents an X-ray of the left wrist and hand, showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalangeal structures. Notably, an irregular fracture is observed in the distal radius, characterized by displacement and angulation, which may indicate trauma. Additionally, there is evidence of sclerosis around the fracture site, suggesting potential underlying osteogenic response or an inflammatory process.

The soft tissue contours surrounding the wrist appear unremarkable, with no sign of significant edema or hematoma. The alignment of the remaining bones is within normal limits, and there is no apparent joint effusion in the radiocarpal or intercarpal spaces. Overall, the radiographic findings warrant further clinical correlation and management to address the fracture and ensure proper healing.
