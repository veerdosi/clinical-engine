The X-ray image displays the left humerus along with adjacent soft tissue structures. There appears to be an abnormal curvature of the bone, indicative of a possible deformity such as a fracture healing in a malaligned position or conditions like osteogenesis imperfecta. Additionally, there may be signs of periosteal reaction, which can suggest underlying pathology including infection or tumor processes.
