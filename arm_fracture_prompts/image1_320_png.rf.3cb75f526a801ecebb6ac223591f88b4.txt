The radiograph depicts a right humerus in a lateral view, showing a potential fracture of the mid-shaft region. There is a noticeable cortical disruption along the diaphysis, indicating a complete transverse fracture, which may be associated with localized edema in the surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral head appears intact, suggesting that dislocation is unlikely in this projection.
