The X-ray image displayed demonstrates a lateral view of the right foot, including the metatarsals and phalanges. There is an evident deformity involving the hallux (big toe), which appears to be laterally deviated, suggestive of hallux valgus deformity. Additionally, there are signs of potential osteophyte formation at the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which may indicate degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis in this region.
