The X-ray image depicts the left upper limb, showcasing the humerus and the radius along with the ulna. There is observable evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by a transverse fracture line and potential displacement of fragments. The surrounding soft tissue may demonstrate signs of edema, indicating a possible associated contusion or inflammation adjacent to the fracture site.
