The X-ray image primarily shows the right femur, with a clear view of the proximal and midshaft regions. There is an observable deformity characterized by a significant angular displacement, indicative of possible malalignment due to a fracture or other pathological condition. Additionally, the cortical bone appears to show increased radiolucency in certain areas, which may suggest underlying pathologies such as osteopenia or malignancy.
