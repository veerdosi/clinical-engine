The lateral X-ray of the elbow reveals a significant angular deformity characterized by a varus alignment. There is evidence of a malunion at the medial aspect of the humerus, suggesting previous traumatic injury with incomplete healing. Additionally, the presence of surgical hardware is noted within the joint space, indicative of prior orthopedic intervention for fracture fixation or osteosynthesis.
