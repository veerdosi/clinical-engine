The X-ray image displays the distal radius and carpal bones, revealing a notable fracture of the distal radius characterized by dorsal angulation and possible comminution. In addition, there is evidence of some soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating a potential acute injury. The alignment of the carpal bones is preserved; however, any distraction or misalignment may suggest instability at the wrist joint.
