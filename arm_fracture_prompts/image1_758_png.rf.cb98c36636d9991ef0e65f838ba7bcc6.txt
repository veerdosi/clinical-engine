The provided X-ray image of the elbow joint reveals an abnormal angulation in the distal humerus and the proximal ulna, indicating a possible angular deformity. There is also evidence of joint effusion within the olecranon bursa, which may suggest synovitis or a potential underlying inflammatory condition. Additionally, the radiographic findings may indicate signs of osteophyte formation at the joint margins, potentially reflecting underlying degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis.
