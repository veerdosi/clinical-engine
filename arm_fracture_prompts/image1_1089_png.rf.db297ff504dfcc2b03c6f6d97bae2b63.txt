The X-ray image displays a complex surgical fixation involving the distal humerus and the proximal ulna, suggesting prior trauma or instability in this region. The presence of metallic hardware indicates an orthopedic intervention, likely a plate and screw constructs, used to stabilize fractures or correct deformity in the elbow joint. Notably, the alignment of the osseous structures appears compromised, which may suggest the existence of malunion or nonunion of the fracture sites.
