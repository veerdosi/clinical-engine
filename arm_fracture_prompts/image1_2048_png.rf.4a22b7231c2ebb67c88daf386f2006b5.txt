The X-ray image predominantly reveals a fracture through the distal radius, characterized by a notable misalignment at the fracture site. Surrounding the fracture, there is a presence of periosteal callus formation indicative of the body's healing response post-injury. Additionally, the articulation of the wrist joint appears compromised, possibly suggesting an associated intra-articular injury or disruption of the distal radioulnar joint.
