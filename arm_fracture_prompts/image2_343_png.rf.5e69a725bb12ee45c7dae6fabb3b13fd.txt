The X-ray image depicts the right arm of a patient, showcasing the anatomical structures of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable observations include the alignment of the elbow joint, which appears intact, but there is potential for radiolucency indicating possible subcutaneous soft tissue edema or inflammation. Additionally, joint space narrowing may be observed, suggestive of degenerative changes or arthritis impacting the elbow region.
