The X-ray demonstrates a clear indication of a fracture in the distal radius and ulna, characterized by displacement and angulation. There is evident fracture line visibility in both bones, suggesting a complete fracture pattern with the presence of callus formation at the fracture sites. No signs of joint effusion or foreign bodies are noted in the surrounding soft tissues, which appear unremarkable in the examined area.
