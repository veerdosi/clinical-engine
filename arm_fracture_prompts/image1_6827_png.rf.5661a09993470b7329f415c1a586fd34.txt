The image reveals an X-ray of the distal arm, capturing the elbow joint and surrounding bony structures. There appears to be an irregularity at the lateral aspect of the humerus, raising suspicion for a potential fracture or an abnormal bony protuberance indicative of osteophyte formation. Soft tissue surrounding the joint shows signs of edema, which may suggest the presence of inflammation or effusion.
