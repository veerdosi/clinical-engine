The X-ray image reveals an oblique view of the humeral shaft with a visible deformity. There is a significant angular deformity noted in the mid-shaft region, suggesting possible diaphyseal fracture malunion or congenital deformity. Additionally, the alignment of the distal and proximal segments of the humerus appears compromised, potentially indicating an underlying pathological condition affecting the bone structure.
