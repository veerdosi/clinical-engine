The provided X-ray image reveals the right forearm, including the radius and ulna. There is evident cortical disruption in the midshaft region of the radius, indicative of a transverse fracture, while the ulna appears intact. No acute dislocation is noted at the distal radioulnar joint, but soft tissue swelling may be present, suggesting a potential associated injury.
