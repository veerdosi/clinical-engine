The X-ray image demonstrates a radiolucent area surrounding the femoral prosthesis in the proximal femur, indicative of possible periprosthetic osteolysis. There is evidence of a well-cemented stem with appropriate positioning in the femoral canal, but the presence of a lucent line suggests a potential loosening of the implant. Additionally, cortical thinning can be observed in the distal femur, which may warrant further investigation for any signs of osteopenia or mechanical failure.
