The image displays a lateral radiograph of the left shoulder, highlighting the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding bony structures. There is a presence of joint effusion, indicated by soft tissue swelling around the glenohumeral joint, which may suggest underlying pathology such as inflammatory arthropathy or bursitis. Additionally, signs of possible degenerative changes are observable in the acromioclavicular joint, characterized by osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing, indicative of osteoarthritis.
