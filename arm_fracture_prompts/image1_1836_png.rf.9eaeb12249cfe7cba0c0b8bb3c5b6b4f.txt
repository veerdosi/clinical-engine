The X-ray image demonstrates a PA (posterior-anterior) view of the right wrist and distal forearm, highlighting the scaphoid and distal radius. There is visible malalignment evident in the distal radius, suggesting a possible fracture, with an accompanying step-off at the fracture site. Additionally, the radiolucency observed in the vicinity of the scaphoid may indicate the presence of an associated avascular necrosis or other underlying osseous pathology.
