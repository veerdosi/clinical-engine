The provided X-ray image demonstrates the forearm in anteroposterior view, revealing the radial and ulnar bones. Notably, there is an acute fracture observed in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by disruption of cortical continuity and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the alignment of the bone is slightly altered, indicating possible angulation at the fracture site, which may require further assessment for any complications such as malunion or nonunion.
