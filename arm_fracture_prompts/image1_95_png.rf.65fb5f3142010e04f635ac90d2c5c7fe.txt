The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the right hand, showing the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a possible fracture or dislocation in the proximal phalanx of the ring finger, characterized by a break in the cortical bone. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears to be intact, with no evident signs of acute edema or pneumothorax observed in the immediate area.
