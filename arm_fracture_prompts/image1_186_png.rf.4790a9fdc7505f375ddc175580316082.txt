The X-ray image depicts the elbow joint, highlighting the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. A prominent feature is the presence of an osteophyte at the lateral aspect of the olecranon, suggestive of osteoarthritis. There is no visible joint effusion, but there may be signs of joint degeneration indicated by subchondral sclerosis and joint space narrowing.
