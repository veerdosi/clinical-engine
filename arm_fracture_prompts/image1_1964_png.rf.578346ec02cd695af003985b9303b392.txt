The X-ray image reveals an abnormal curvature of the proximal phalanx, suggesting the presence of a bunion or hallux valgus deformity. The alignment of the metatarsophalangeal joint appears compromised, with potential lateral deviation of the hallux. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the affected area, indicating possible inflammation or degenerative changes associated with the underlying condition.
