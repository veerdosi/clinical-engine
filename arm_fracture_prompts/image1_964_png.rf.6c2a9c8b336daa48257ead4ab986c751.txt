The image depicts an X-ray of the distal femur and proximal tibia, prominently showing a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with metallic components. There is evidence of periprosthetic bone remodeling, as indicated by radiolucent lines surrounding the femoral and tibial components, which may suggest aseptic loosening. Additionally, the alignment of the prosthesis appears appropriate, with no significant angular deformities noted in the surrounding bony structures.
