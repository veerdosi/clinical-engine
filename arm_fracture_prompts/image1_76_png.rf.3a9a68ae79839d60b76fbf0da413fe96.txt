The X-ray image demonstrates a displaced fracture in the distal phalanx of the toe, evident by the misalignment of the bone fragments. The fracture is characterized by two prominent radiopaque lines indicating the fracture site with potential underlying soft tissue edema. Additionally, the joint proximal to the fracture appears intact, with no signs of joint effusion or significant arthritic changes evident in the visualized area.
