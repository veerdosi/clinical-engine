The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint, with notable radiolucency in the region of the distal femur and proximal tibia. There appears to be an irregularity in the cortical margins, suggestive of possible osteolytic lesions or subchondral bone changes. Additionally, the joint space shows signs of narrowing, which may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis or intraarticular pathology.
