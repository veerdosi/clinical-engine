The X-ray demonstrates a significant angulation deformity in the distal radius, indicative of a possible fracture or malunion. There is also evidence of periosteal reaction along the midsection of the forearm bones, suggestive of underlying pathology such as stress injury or chronic irritation. Additionally, the joint spaces appear well-preserved, with no signs of acute effusion or arthritic changes in the elbow region.
