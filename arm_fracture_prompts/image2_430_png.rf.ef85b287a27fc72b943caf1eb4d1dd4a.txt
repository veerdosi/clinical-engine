The X-ray depicts a left humerus with evidence of a significant angulation deformity at the distal end. There appears to be an area of cortical disruption indicative of a probable fracture nonunion, characterized by a loss of continuity in the bony architecture. Additionally, there is a notable soft tissue shadow adjacent to the fracture site, which could suggest the presence of edema or hematoma formation.
