The X-ray image depicts the right hand, clearly showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notably, there appears to be an abnormality in the alignment of the metacarpal bones, indicating potential signs of malunion or injury. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing at the carpometacarpal joint, which may suggest degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
