The X-ray image of the left wrist demonstrates a well-defined periprosthetic lucency surrounding the distal radius, suggesting possible osteolytic lesions. There is also evidence of a fracture line noted through the distal radius, indicative of either an acute fracture or chronic stress response. Additionally, the carpal bones appear to maintain normal alignment, with no signs of significant dislocation or joint effusion identified in the radiographic evaluation.
