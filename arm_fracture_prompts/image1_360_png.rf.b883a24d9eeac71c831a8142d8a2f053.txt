The X-ray image reveals a left forearm with the presence of significant soft tissue swelling and possible bone alignment abnormalities. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, which may contribute to misalignment and instability of the wrist joint. The visualization also suggests potential involvement of the carpal bones, indicating the need for further assessment to evaluate for any additional osseous injuries or complications.
