The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left lower extremity, including the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there appears to be an abnormal alignment at the knee joint, with potential osteoarthritic changes observed in the proximal tibiofemoral articulation. Additionally, there is evidence of cortical thinning in the diaphysis of the tibia, suggestive of possible osteopenia or previous stress fractures.
