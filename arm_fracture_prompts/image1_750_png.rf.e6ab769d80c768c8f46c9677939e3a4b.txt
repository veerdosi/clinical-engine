The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint, showing an orthopedic implant positioned within the femur and tibia. There is evidence of osteophyte formation surrounding the joint, indicating degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. The presence of the implant suggests a previous surgical intervention, potentially a total knee arthroplasty, in response to significant joint pathology.
