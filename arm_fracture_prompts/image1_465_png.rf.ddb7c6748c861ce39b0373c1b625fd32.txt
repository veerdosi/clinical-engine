The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left shoulder, showcasing the glenohumeral joint and the proximal humerus. There is an observable humeral head that appears to be displaced, indicative of a potential shoulder dislocation. Additionally, there is a possible avulsion fracture of the greater tuberosity, characterized by irregular contours along the humeral surface, which may suggest associated soft tissue injury.
