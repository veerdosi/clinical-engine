The X-ray image reveals a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and abnormal angulation. Additionally, there is evidence of a potential fracture involving the ulnar styloid, which may indicate an associated injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex. The alignment of the carpal bones appears within normal limits, although soft tissue swelling is noted around the wrist joint, suggesting possible contusion or inflammation.
