The radiographic image presents an anteroposterior view of the distal femur, illustrating the presence of an intramedullary fixation device. Notably, there are indications of a previous fracture at the supracondylar region of the femur, with evidence of callus formation adjacent to the fracture site. Furthermore, the alignment of the adjacent joint structures appears preserved, but there is some evidence of osteopenia in the surrounding periarticular bone.
