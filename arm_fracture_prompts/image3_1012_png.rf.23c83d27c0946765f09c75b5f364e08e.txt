The x-ray image displays an altered alignment of the humerus and ulna, indicative of a potential fracture or dislocation in the elbow region. Notable cortical disruption and irregularity can be observed in the distal humerus, suggestive of a possible fracture line. Additionally, there appears to be an abnormality in the soft tissue contours surrounding the joint, potentially reflecting fluid accumulation or hematoma formation.
