The radiograph presents a frontal view of the right knee joint, demonstrating notable joint space narrowing, particularly in the medial compartment, indicative of potential osteoarthritis. There are observable subchondral sclerosis and marginal osteophyte formation at the femoral and tibial articulating surfaces, consistent with degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the presence of joint effusion may be inferred, potentially suggesting underlying inflammatory or degenerative processes affecting the knee structure.
