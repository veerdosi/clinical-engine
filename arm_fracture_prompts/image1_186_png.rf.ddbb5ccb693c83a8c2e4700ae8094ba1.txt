The X-ray image shows the right forearm, encompassing the radius and ulna, with visible alignment and integrity of the cortical bone. Notably, there is a focal point of cortical disruption and associated periosteal reaction, suggesting the presence of an acute fracture involving one or both of the forearm bones. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed, which is indicative of a possible contusion or hematoma surrounding the affected area.
