The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left elbow, displaying an orthopedic fixation device, likely a screw, inserted into the proximal ulna. There is also evidence of a previous fracture in the area, indicated by callus formation surrounding the fracture line, indicative of the healing process. No acute fractures or dislocations are visible at this time, although the presence of the implanted device suggests a prior surgical intervention for fracture stabilization.
