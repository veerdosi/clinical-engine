The X-ray image depicts both the right and left hands, displaying the carpal and phalangeal joints. There is evidence of potential joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation, which may suggest degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, slight subluxation of the proximal interphalangeal joints is observed, indicating possible inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
