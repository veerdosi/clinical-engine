The X-ray provided depicts the right shoulder joint, revealing a potential humeral head deformity characterized by irregular contours. Notably, there is a presence of decreased joint space and possible subacromial impingement, which could indicate the presence of rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, any signs of osteophyte formation along the acromioclavicular joint may suggest signs of osteoarthritis in this region.
