The X-ray image depicts a humeral shaft fracture, characterized by an irregularity in the cortical outline of the humerus with associated periosteal reaction. A metallic fixation device is prominently noted, indicating prior surgical intervention for fracture stabilization, suggestive of either an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral bones appears compromised, which may indicate a specific angular deformity as a consequence of the fracture.
