The X-ray image displays a forearm with an internal fixation device prominently positioned along the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a previous fracture in the midshaft region of either the radius, ulna, or both, indicated by the alignment of the metallic implant. Surrounding the implant, there may be signs of callus formation, suggesting the healing response of the osseous tissue to the fracture.
