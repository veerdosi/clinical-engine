The X-ray displays a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus, evident by the misalignment at the surgical neck. There is notable cortical disruption and potential involvement of the surrounding soft tissues, which could indicate accompanying hematoma or edema. Additionally, the acromion and glenoid structures appear intact, suggesting no dislocation, although further evaluation may be warranted for associated injuries.
