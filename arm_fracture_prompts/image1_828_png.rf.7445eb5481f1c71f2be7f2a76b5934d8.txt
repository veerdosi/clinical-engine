The radiograph depicts a lateral view of the left forearm, showing a metallic orthopedic fixation device, likely an intramedullary nail or plate, situated along the length of the ulna. There is evidence of callus formation surrounding the fracture site, indicating the healing process post-fracture stabilization. Additionally, the alignment of the bone appears to be adequate, with no significant displacement noted at the fracture site, suggesting appropriate management of the injury.
