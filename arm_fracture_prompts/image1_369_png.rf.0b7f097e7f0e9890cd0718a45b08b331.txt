The X-ray image depicts an elbow joint with notable displacement and misalignment of the radial head, suggestive of a possible radial head fracture. There is also an apparent humeral condylar irregularity, indicating potential joint effusion or inflammation in the region. The surrounding soft tissue shows signs of edema, which may accompany trauma or pathological processes affecting the elbow joint complex.
