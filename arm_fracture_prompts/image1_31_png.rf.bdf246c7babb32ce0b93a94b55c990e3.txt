The X-ray image reveals an alignment anomaly in the distal humerus and proximal radius, suggesting potential displacement or malalignment. Notable is the presence of altered joint space in the elbow region, which may indicate degenerative changes or a prior joint effusion. Additionally, signs of osseous formation or periosteal reaction could suggest chronic inflammatory changes or a previous fracture that may not have healed appropriately.
