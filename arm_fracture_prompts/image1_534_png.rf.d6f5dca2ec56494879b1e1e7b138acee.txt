The X-ray image presented shows the left knee joint in a lateral view, highlighting the articulation between the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased density around the joint space, which may suggest the presence of synovial fluid accumulation, commonly associated with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. Additionally, the subchondral bone appears to exhibit changes consistent with osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible osteophyte formation.
