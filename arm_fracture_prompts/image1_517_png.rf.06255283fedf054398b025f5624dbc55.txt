The X-ray image demonstrates the elbow joint, highlighting the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. There is a notable presence of a joint effusion indicated by soft tissue swelling around the olecranon fossa, which may suggest inflammatory or degenerative changes. Additionally, the articular surfaces appear irregular, indicative of potential osteoarthritic alterations or previous trauma, warranting further clinical evaluation.
