The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint, demonstrating the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an incongruity in the articular surface of the capitellum, potentially indicative of chondral injury or osteochondritis dissecans. Additionally, soft tissue characteristics surrounding the joint may suggest the presence of an effusion or synovitis.
