The X-ray image depicts the distal humerus and proximal radius, showing an apparent osteolytic lesion near the elbow joint. The well-defined cortical margins suggest a pathological process, possibly indicative of a bone tumor or an aggressive benign lesion. Surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, further emphasizing localized pathological changes in this region.
