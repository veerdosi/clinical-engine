The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the proximal phalanx of the right hand, showing an irregularity at the base of the middle phalanx that may suggest a bony anomaly. There is also evidence of potential joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which can indicate an underlying degenerative process. Additionally, there is a presence of subarticular sclerosis adjacent to the joint surfaces, which may be associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis or traumatic changes.
