The X-ray image of the wrist reveals a possible wrist fracture, specifically at the distal radius, characterized by a cortical interruption and displacement. Additionally, there appears to be evidence of an intra-articular component involving the radiocarpal joint, which may suggest a complex fracture pattern. Surrounding soft tissues show signs of edema, indicative of potential trauma or inflammatory response associated with the underlying injury.
