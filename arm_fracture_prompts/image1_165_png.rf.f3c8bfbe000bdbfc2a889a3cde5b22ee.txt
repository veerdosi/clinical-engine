The X-ray image displays the digital bones of the fingers, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is notable evidence of a fracture in one or more of the distal phalanges, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone outline, suggesting an acute traumatic event. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling visible adjacent to the skeletal structures, indicative of an associated inflammatory response.
