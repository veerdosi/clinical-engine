The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left forearm, revealing an apparent fracture of the radius. Alignment and continuity of the cortical bone are disrupted at the fracture site, indicating a possible angular deformity. The notation "POST REDUCTION" suggests that this image was taken following a closed reduction procedure to realign the fractured bone segments.
