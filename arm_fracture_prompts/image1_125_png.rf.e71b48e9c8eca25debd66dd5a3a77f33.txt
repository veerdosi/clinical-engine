The X-ray image reveals a right forearm with both the radius and ulna in profile view. There is a notable transverse mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by displacement and potential angulation. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction surrounding the fracture site, suggesting an acute injury, possibly with a concern for underlying soft tissue compromise.
