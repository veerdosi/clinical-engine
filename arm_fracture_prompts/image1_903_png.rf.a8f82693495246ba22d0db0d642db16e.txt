The X-ray depicts the distal femur and proximal tibia, revealing a well-defined area of radiolucency in the medial aspect, which may suggest a potential osteolytic lesion. There is a noticeable joint effusion in the suprapatellar space, indicating synovitis or potential intra-articular pathology. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit signs of edema, which could be associated with an underlying inflammatory or traumatic process.
