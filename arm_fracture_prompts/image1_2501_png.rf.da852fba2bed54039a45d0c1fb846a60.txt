The provided image is an anteroposterior (AP) X-ray of the right shoulder, demonstrating the relationship between the humerus and the scapula. Notable findings include the presence of a possible acromioclavicular joint osteophyte formation, which may suggest chronic degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, potentially indicating impingement or rotator cuff pathology.
