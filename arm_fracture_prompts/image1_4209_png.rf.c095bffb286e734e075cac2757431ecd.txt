The image depicts an X-ray of a hand, specifically focusing on the upper digit (likely the little finger) with notable deformities present. There is evidence of a phalanx fracture characterized by displacement and possible angular deformity, suggesting an acute injury to the digit. Adjacent to the fracture site, there appears to be soft tissue swelling, which may indicate an associated contusion or hematoma.
