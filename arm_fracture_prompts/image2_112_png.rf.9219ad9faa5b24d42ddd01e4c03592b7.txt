The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the left forearm, revealing an intramedullary fixation device along the diaphysis of the ulna and radius. There is an observable fracture line indicating a mid-shaft fracture, which is likely subject to stabilization by the inserted hardware, suggesting previous operative intervention. Surrounding the fracture site, there is potential evidence of callus formation, indicating a healing process in response to the osteotomy or trauma presented.
