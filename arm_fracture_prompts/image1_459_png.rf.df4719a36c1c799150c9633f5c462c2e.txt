The image displays an anteroposterior (AP) view of the right wrist, revealing both the distal radius and ulna. There is a notable alignment of the carpal bones, but the distal radius exhibits a volar angulation, which may indicate a potential fracture or deformity. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident around the region, suggesting possible traumatic injury or acute pathology.
