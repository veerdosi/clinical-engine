The image depicts an X-ray of the forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna. There is a notable fracture present in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity of the cortical bone and potential displacement of the fracture ends. Additionally, there is observable soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which suggests a possible concomitant soft tissue injury.
