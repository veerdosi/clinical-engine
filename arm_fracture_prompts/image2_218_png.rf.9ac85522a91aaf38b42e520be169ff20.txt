The X-ray presents a right forearm with notable alterations in the radial and ulnar bones. There is evidence of cortical discontinuity consistent with a fracture in the midshaft of the radius, associated with signs of potential malalignment. The ulnar bone appears intact; however, the presence of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site may suggest underlying edema or hematoma formation.
