The X-ray image depicts the left arm, specifically the humerus, radius, and ulna, as well as the elbow joint. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal humeral region characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and possible displacement. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the elbow, indicating a potential intra-articular injury or inflammation associated with the fracture.
