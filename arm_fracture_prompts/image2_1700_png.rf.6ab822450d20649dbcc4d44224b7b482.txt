The X-ray image displays the left forearm, showing clear alignment of the radius and ulna with no significant misalignment or angulation. However, proximal to the wrist joint, there is a visible fracture line across the distal radius, which suggests a potential fracture of the wrist region. Additionally, there is a post-splint notation, indicating that immobilization has been applied to manage the fracture and promote healing.
