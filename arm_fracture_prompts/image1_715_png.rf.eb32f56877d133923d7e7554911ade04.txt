The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding soft tissues. There is evidence of increased radiolucency in the proximal humerus, indicative of possible osteolytic lesions that may suggest underlying pathology. Additionally, the acromion appears to exhibit superior migration, which could be consistent with rotator cuff pathology or degenerative changes.
