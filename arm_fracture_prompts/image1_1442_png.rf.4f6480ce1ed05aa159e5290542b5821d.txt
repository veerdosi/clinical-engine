The X-ray image displays the left hand, revealing the bony architecture of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable is the presence of a corticomedullary distinction within the phalangeal bones, which may indicate conditions such as osteopenia or osteoporosis if aligned with corresponding clinical findings. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, particularly at the proximal interphalangeal joints, which could suggest the onset of degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis.
