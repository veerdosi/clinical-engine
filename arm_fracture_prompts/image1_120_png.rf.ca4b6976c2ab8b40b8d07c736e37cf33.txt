There is evidence of osteoarthritic changes characterized by joint space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation at the carpometacarpal joints, particularly of the thumb. Additionally, there are signs of subchondral sclerosis, indicative of degenerative joint disease, evident in the distal interphalangeal joints.
