The X-ray demonstrates a left elbow joint in a lateral view, revealing a significant irregularity in the ulna's alignment suggestive of elbow deformity. Notable is the presence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency around the elbow joint, which may suggest inflammatory conditions or trauma. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the region, further indicating the potential for an underlying pathologic process.
