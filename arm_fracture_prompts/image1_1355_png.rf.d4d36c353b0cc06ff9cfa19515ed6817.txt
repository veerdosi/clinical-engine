The X-ray reveals a lateral view of the right shoulder, showcasing the glenohumeral joint and surrounding bony structures. Notably, there is an articulation between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity, with potential signs of rotator cuff pathology indicated by the absence of normal bony contours or abnormalities in the soft tissue shadowing. Additionally, there may be signs of acromioclavicular joint degeneration or an associated bony prominence, which could suggest underlying osteoarthritis or impingement syndrome at the shoulder girdle.
