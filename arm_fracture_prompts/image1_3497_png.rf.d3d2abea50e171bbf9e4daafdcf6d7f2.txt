The X-ray image displays a wrist joint with notable findings. There is an indication of a scaphoid fracture, evidenced by a fracture line through the scaphoid bone, which is critical for wrist stability. Additionally, evidence of potential healing is observed through the presence of a metallic fixation device, suggesting that surgical intervention may have been performed to stabilize the fracture.
