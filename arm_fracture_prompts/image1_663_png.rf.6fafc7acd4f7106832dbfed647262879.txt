The provided X-ray image of the knee joint demonstrates a significant joint effusion, characterized by an increased radiolucency around the femoral and tibial condyles. There is evidence of osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, indicative of osteoarthritis, which is commonly associated with chronic degenerative changes. Additionally, the alignment of the femur and tibia appears altered, suggesting potential malalignment or deformity impacting the knee's biomechanical function.
