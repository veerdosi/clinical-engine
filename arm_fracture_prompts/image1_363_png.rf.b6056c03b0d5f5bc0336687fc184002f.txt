The image depicts a lateral X-ray view of the elbow joint, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is a misalignment at the elbow joint suggesting possible joint dislocation or malalignment, which can impact range of motion and overall functionality. Further evaluation should assess for any accompanying fractures or soft tissue injuries, which may be visible in adjacent areas of the X-ray.
