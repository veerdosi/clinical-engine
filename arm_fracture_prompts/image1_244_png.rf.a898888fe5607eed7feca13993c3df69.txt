The X-ray depicts the left forearm, specifically highlighting the distal radius and ulna, as well as the associated carpal region. There is evidence of a fracture, characterized by discontinuity of the cortical bone in the distal radius, with potential displacement observed. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present, suggesting an associated contusion or hematoma adjacent to the fracture site.
