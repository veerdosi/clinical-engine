The X-ray image depicts the left hand, specifically showcasing the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a deviation in alignment suggesting possible deformity, which may indicate conditions such as ulnar deviation or finger misalignment. The joint spaces appear to be preserved, but there may be subtle signs of osteoarthritis in the proximal interphalangeal joints, indicated by the presence of marginal osteophytes.
