The X-ray image depicts the left arm in an oblique view, illustrating the ulna and radius in relation to the humerus at the elbow joint. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture with potential angulation noted, suggesting a possible fracture deformity. Additionally, there appears to be slight subluxation at the radial head, which may indicate an associated injury to the surrounding soft tissue structures.
