The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal curvature of the proximal ulna, indicative of a possible orthopedic deformity. A distinct fracture line is observed in the midshaft region of the radius, suggesting a traumatic injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is visible adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate an associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
