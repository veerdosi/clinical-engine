The X-ray reveals an abnormality in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by an irregular bone contour and suggestive of a possible bone lesion. Notably, there is a lack of significant cortical continuity, raising suspicion for either a benign or malignant entity such as a cystic lesion, a fracture non-union, or possibly an osteosarcoma. Furthermore, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected area may indicate underlying inflammatory or neoplastic processes that warrant further investigation.
