The X-ray image presents a left lower limb, specifically illustrating the tibia and fibula. There appears to be significant cortical disruption in the diaphysis of the tibia, suggesting a possible fracture or segmental bone loss. Additionally, further examination reveals signs of periosteal reaction, which may indicate underlying pathology such as infection or neoplastic processes.
