The X-ray reveals a right wrist, demonstrating a prominent scaphoid bone with a visible fracture line through its waist, indicative of a possible scaphoid fracture. There is also associated sclerosis and lucency surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest early signs of avascular necrosis. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius appears intact, with no evident displacement or angulation, indicating stability in the adjacent structures.
