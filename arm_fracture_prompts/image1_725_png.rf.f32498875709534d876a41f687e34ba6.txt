The X-ray image depicts an oblique view of a hand, focusing on the phalanges of a finger. There are evident signs of a fracture, characterized by a discontinuity in the bony cortex of the proximal phalanx, indicated by radiolucency adjacent to the fracture site. Additionally, signs of callus formation may be present, suggesting a healing process in response to the fracture.
