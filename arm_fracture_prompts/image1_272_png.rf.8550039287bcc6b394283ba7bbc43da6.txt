The provided X-ray image of the left arm demonstrates a notable lucency in the region of the humeral midshaft, indicating a potential cortical bone deficit or fracture. There appears to be displacement at the fracture site, which may suggest a complete or incomplete fracture, necessitating further evaluation of alignment and stability. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the joint, which could indicate associated trauma or inflammatory response.
