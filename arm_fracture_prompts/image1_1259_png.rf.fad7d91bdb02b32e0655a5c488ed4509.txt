The X-ray shows a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint. There is apparent subluxation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity, suggesting potential instability or previous dislocation. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes around the joint space may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
