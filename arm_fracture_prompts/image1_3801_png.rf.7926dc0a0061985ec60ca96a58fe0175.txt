The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of a left hand, showcasing the alignment and integrity of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a potential fracture, observed in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by an abnormal alignment and possible periosteal reaction. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicated by a subtle increase in the soft tissue density surrounding the joint margin.
