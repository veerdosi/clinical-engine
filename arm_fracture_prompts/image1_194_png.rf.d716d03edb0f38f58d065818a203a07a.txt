The X-ray image depicts the bones of the hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a significant fracture involving the distal phalanx, characterized by misalignment and cortical discontinuity. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred from the positioning and appearance of the surrounding structures, suggesting potential associated injuries or hematoma formation.
