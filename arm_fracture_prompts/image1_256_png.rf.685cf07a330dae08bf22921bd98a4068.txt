The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the right knee joint, revealing potential bone spurs on the femur and tibia, indicative of osteophytosis, commonly associated with degenerative joint disease. Joint space narrowing can be observed, suggesting signs of osteoarthritis, which may result in decreased cartilage thickness and impaired joint function. Additionally, there are no acute fractures noted, though any subchondral bone changes may indicate underlying chronic pathology in the knee structure.
