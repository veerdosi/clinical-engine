The X-ray image displays the phalangeal bones of the hand, showing the proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. Notably, there appears to be a bone deformity characterized by an altered alignment or angulation, indicative of possible malunion or nonunion of the phalanges. Additionally, the joint spaces between the phalanges may exhibit changes suggestive of osteoarthritis, evidenced by potential joint narrowing and subarticular sclerosis.
