The X-ray image of the left forearm demonstrates an evident fracture of the distal radius, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and possible involvement of the growth plate. There may also be signs of bone alignment impairment and soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, indicating acute inflammation. Additionally, the phalangeal bones exhibit an alignment typical of post-traumatic alterations, and there may be indications of a potential scaphoid bone fracture or other carpal involvement due to the hand positioning.
