The image presents an X-ray of the left arm, specifically highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is notable cortical disruption observed in the mid-shaft of the radius, suggesting the presence of a fracture, characterized by a complete break in continuity of the bone. Additionally, there is possible soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, which may indicate a traumatic injury or underlying pathology.
