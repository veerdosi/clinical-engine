The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder initially demonstrating a potential glenohumeral joint effusion, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process. Notably, there is evidence of a possible humeral head avulsion, indicated by irregularities along the articular surface. Additionally, the acromioclavicular joint appears to be within normal limits, with no signs of dislocation or significant degenerative changes.
