The image presents an X-ray of the left hand, displaying multiple views of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable in the X-ray are signs of potential joint effusion in the interphalangeal joints, which may suggest inflammatory arthropathy. Additionally, there are subtle cortical irregularities along the second and third metacarpals indicative of potential osteochondral lesions.
