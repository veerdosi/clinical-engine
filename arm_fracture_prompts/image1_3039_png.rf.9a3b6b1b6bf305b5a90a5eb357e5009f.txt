The X-ray reveals a post-operative view of the distal radius and ulna, with a plate and screws in place, indicating surgical intervention likely following a fracture. There is evident consolidation at the fracture site, with normal alignment of the distal radius, but the presence of metallic hardware suggests a history of surgical stabilization for a fracture correction. No acute bony lesions or signs of post-surgical complications, such as infection or malunion, are observed in this imaging.
