The provided image is an X-ray of the forearm, specifically displaying both the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a transverse fracture in the shaft of the radius, characterized by a clean break across the bone cortex, indicative of acute trauma. Additionally, there is slight cortical irregularity in the distal ulna, which may suggest a stress response or a previous injury not fully healed.
