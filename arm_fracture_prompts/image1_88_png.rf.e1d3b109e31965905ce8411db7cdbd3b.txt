The provided X-ray image displays the bones of the wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal regions. There is evidence of potential displacement or angulation in the distal radius and ulna, which could suggest trauma or an acute fracture. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed in areas, raising suspicion for possible degenerative changes or other underlying arthropathies.

Moreover, the alignment of the phalanges indicates possible malalignment that may correlate with previous trauma or congenital deformities. Visible soft tissue swelling can also be inferred around the affected regions, indicative of an inflammatory response. The overall bone density appears within normal limits, but careful evaluation of cortical outlines is warranted to assess for any subtle pathological changes.
