The image depicts an anteroposterior view of the left elbow joint, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notably, there is a visible fracture line at the olecranon of the ulna, indicating an acute fracture likely involving the bony architecture of the elbow. Additionally, there is associated joint effusion, suggestive of potential intra-articular involvement and inflammatory changes consistent with trauma.
