The radiograph demonstrates a lateral view of the left knee joint, revealing subchondral sclerosis adjacent to the medial femoral condyle. There is evidence of joint space narrowing suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by the presence of osteophytes at the articular margins. Additionally, the presence of a possible effusion may be inferred due to the soft tissue shadow around the joint, indicating synovial inflammation or other pathological processes.
