The radiograph displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable findings include a visible joint effusion and possible osteophyte formation at the radial head, suggestive of degenerative changes. Additionally, there is presence of periarticular osteopenia, potentially indicating an inflammatory process affecting the surrounding soft tissues and bone density.
