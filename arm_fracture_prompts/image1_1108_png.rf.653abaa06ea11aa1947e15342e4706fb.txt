The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, with particular attention to the elbow joint. There is evidence of a potential joint effusion, as indicated by the radiolucent area adjacent to the joint space, which may suggest intra-articular pathology. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears to show some deviation from their normal anatomical positioning, which could be indicative of a fracture or dislocation.
