The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the forearm, revealing an intramedullary nail fixation in the radius. There is evidence of a complex fracture pattern, indicative of a comminuted fracture involving both the distal and proximal segments of the radius. Additionally, signs of callus formation around the fracture site suggest a healing process, while cortical disruption is noted, highlighting the severity of the injury.
