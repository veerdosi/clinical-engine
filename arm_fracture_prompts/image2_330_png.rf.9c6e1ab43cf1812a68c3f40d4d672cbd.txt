The x-ray image illustrates a left elbow with the presence of an internal fixation device, indicative of a previous surgical intervention for an acute fracture. There is evidence of multiple metallic screws and a plate utilized to stabilize the fracture, likely involving the distal humerus or proximal ulna. The surrounding bony structures appear intact but may demonstrate signs consistent with post-operative changes such as callus formation or potential residual edema.
