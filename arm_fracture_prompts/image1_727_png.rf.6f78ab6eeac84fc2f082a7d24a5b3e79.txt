The image depicts a lateral view of the left knee joint, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula in alignment. There appear to be signs of joint effusion, as evidenced by an increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar area, which may indicate the presence of excess synovial fluid. Additionally, there could be evidence of osteophyte formation around the patellofemoral joint, suggestive of potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
