The X-ray image depicts a medial oblique fracture of the distal femur that presents with significant displacement. There is evidence of a previous orthopedic intervention, suggested by the presence of metallic hardware, such as plates or screws, which indicates prior fixation of a fracture or correction of a deformity. Additionally, joint alignment at the knee appears altered, suggesting possible associated complications, including malunion or nonunion.
