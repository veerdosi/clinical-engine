The X-ray image depicts a right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal bones of the digit. There is a notable curvature of the proximal phalanx that may suggest the presence of a bowing deformity or potential malalignment. Additionally, the distal phalanx exhibits signs of osteolytic changes, which may indicate an underlying pathologic process such as infection or a neoplastic lesion.
