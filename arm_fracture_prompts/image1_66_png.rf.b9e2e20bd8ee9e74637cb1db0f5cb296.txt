The X-ray depicts a left forearm with notable findings. There is an apparent deformity characterized by a marked curvature of the ulna, suggestive of possible ulnar bowing, which may indicate underlying conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta or rickets. Additionally, the cortical bone appears to be intact without evident fractures, though further evaluation is warranted to assess the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues.
