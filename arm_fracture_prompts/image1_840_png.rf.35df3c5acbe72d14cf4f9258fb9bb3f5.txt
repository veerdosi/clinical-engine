The X-ray image depicts the left hand, clearly exhibiting the carpal and metacarpal bones, including detailed visualization of the phalanges. There is evidence of possible joint effusion in the interphalangeal spaces, which may indicate the presence of inflammatory conditions. Additionally, slight misalignment or deformity in the proximal phalanx may suggest possible ostoarthritis or trauma to the phalangeal joints.
