The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the midshaft of the humerus, characterized by an angular displacement and a clear disruption of the cortical bone. The presence of an intramedullary nail suggests surgical intervention for stabilization, as evidenced by surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may indicate associated hematoma or inflammation. No signs of infection or osteomyelitis are apparent in the image, but further evaluation is necessary to assess alignment and healing progress.
