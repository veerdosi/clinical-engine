The X-ray demonstrates a fracture of the right distal humerus, with a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Notably, there is associated bone edema visualized in the surrounding soft tissue, suggesting possible periosteal reaction. Additionally, alignment of the adjacent radial and ulnar bones appears intact, indicating that the injury may be localized to the humeral region.
