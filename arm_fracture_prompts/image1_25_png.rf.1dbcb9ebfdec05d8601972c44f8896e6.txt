The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna of the wrist, showcasing the carpal bones and the proximal phalanges of the hand. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity and abnormal alignment, possibly indicating a distal radius fracture. Additional observations may suggest signs of ligamentous injury or joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, warranting further clinical correlation.
