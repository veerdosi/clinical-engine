The provided X-ray image shows an orthopaedic fixation device in place, indicating previous surgical intervention for a fracture. There is evidence of a distal radius fracture with the presence of metallic hardware, likely indicating the use of a plate and screws for stabilization. The surrounding bone shows signs of callus formation, suggesting a healing process post-operative stabilization of the fracture site.
