The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, focusing on the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella. There is notable joint effusion, which is indicative of potential underlying pathology such as synovitis or traumatic injury. Additionally, the image may reveal signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, although further evaluation is required for definitive diagnosis.
