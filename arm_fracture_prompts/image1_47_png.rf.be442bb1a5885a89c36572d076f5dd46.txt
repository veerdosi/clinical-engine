The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna in relation to each other. There is a significant joint effusion present, indicated by the lucent area around the olecranon fossa, which suggests potential inflammatory or traumatic pathology. Additionally, signs of osteophyte formation may be noted at the joint margins, indicating possible osteoarthritis or degenerative changes within the elbow joint.
