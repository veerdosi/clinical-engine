The x-ray reveals an anterior-posterior view of the right forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna. Notable is a discernible deformity characterized by an excessive angulation in the mid-shaft of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture callus formation due to previous trauma. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling visible adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process.
