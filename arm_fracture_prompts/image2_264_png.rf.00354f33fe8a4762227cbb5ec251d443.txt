The X-ray reveals a significant cortical disruption in the mid-shaft region of the bone, suggestive of a transverse fracture. There is also evidence of surrounding soft tissue swelling, indicative of a possible hematoma associated with the fracture site. Additionally, the periosteal reaction appears pronounced, which may suggest an acute response to injury or underlying pathological changes.
