The X-ray image displays the right lower limb, specifically focusing on the tibia and fibula. A significant area of concern is observed in the mid-shaft of the tibia, where there appears to be a possible cortical disruption, suggestive of a fracture. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, which could indicate a reactive process secondary to the identified lesion.
