The X-ray image demonstrates a left forearm with a significant orthopedic splint in place, indicating prior intervention for a fracture or severe soft tissue injury. There is evident cortical disruption and potential misalignment in the radius and/or ulna, suggestive of a possible fracture line. Additionally, the presence of surrounding soft tissue swelling may indicate acute inflammatory changes, often seen in the context of trauma.
