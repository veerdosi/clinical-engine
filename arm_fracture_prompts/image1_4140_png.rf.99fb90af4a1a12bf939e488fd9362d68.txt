The X-ray image displays a left hand with notable contours of the metacarpals and phalanges, specifically indicating a possible malalignment or deformity. There appears to be an abnormal angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger, which may suggest a condition such as a boutonni√®re deformity. Additionally, the phalanges exhibit signs of joint space narrowing, potentially indicating underlying degenerative changes or inflammatory processes.
