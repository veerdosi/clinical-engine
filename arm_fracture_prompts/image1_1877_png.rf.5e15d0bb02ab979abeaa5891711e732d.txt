The X-ray image displays the right hand, with a focus on the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notable findings include potential misalignment of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may suggest the presence of a fracture or dislocation. The overall bone density appears within normal limits, with no signs of osteopenia or significant degenerative changes observed in the surrounding joints.
