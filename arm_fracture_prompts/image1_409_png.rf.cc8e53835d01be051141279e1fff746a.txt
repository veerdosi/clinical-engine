The provided X-ray image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia in an anteroposterior view. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, potentially indicative of an acute injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed in the surrounding area, which could suggest associated edema or hematoma formation.
