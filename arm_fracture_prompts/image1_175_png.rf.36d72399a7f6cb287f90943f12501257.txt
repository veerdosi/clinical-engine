The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the right hand, revealing the phalanges and metacarpal bones in detail. There appears to be a significant fracture in the middle phalanx of the fourth digit, characterized by misalignment and cortical disruption. Additionally, signs of potential soft tissue swelling are observable, suggesting an accompanying soft tissue injury related to the bony injury.
