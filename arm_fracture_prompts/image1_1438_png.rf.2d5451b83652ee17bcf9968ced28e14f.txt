The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the left knee joint, revealing several metallic fixation devices suggestive of surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. There is notable cortical disruption at the distal femur and proximal tibia, indicative of prior traumatic injury or osteosynthesis procedure. Additionally, mild periosteal reaction may be observed surrounding the areas of fixation, which could suggest remodeling or reactive changes post-surgery.
