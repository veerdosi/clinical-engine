The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left shoulder, revealing a surgical fixation involving multiple metallic plates and screws along the proximal humerus. There is evidence of a surgical procedure likely performed to address a humeral fracture, indicated by the presence of these fixation devices. The alignment of the humeral head appears maintained; however, the presence of hardware suggests prior trauma or pathological fracture necessitating surgical intervention.
