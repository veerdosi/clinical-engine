The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the hand, highlighting the phalangeal alignment of the fingers. There is visible subluxation at the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicating a potential dislocation or joint instability. Additionally, the presence of joint effusion can be inferred from the soft tissue shadows surrounding the involved joint structures, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or traumatic injury.
