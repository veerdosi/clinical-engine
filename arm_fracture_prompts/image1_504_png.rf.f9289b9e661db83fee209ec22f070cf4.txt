The X-ray image shows a left wrist and forearm, revealing multiple metallic fixation devices indicating prior surgical intervention, possibly for the treatment of a fracture or instability. The distal radius and ulna are visualized, and there is notable alignment of the carpal bones, though possible signs of osseous compromise or malunion may be inferred from the presence of hardware. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, but the presence of the fixation elements suggests a history of trauma or surgical correction involving the distal radius or ulnar structures.
