The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disrupted cortical bone and displacement of the fracture line. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, indicating potential associated contusion or hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact; however, any subtle deviations in the radiocarpal joint space could warrant further examination for possible ligamentous injury.
