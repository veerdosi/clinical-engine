The X-ray image depicts the left forearm in an anteroposterior view, with both the radius and ulna adequately visualized. Notably, there is a visible fracture through the midshaft of the ulna, characterized by a discrete disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, signs of potential periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling may be observed adjacent to the fracture site, indicating an inflammatory response commonly associated with acute traumatic injuries.
