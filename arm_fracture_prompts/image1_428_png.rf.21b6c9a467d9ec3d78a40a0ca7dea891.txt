The X-ray image demonstrates the lateral view of the left femur and surrounding structures. There is notable cortical bone irregularity, suggesting potential issues such as osteolytic lesions or cortical thinning, which may indicate underlying pathological processes. Additionally, the joint spaces adjacent to the femur appear broadened, raising concerns for possible inflammatory or degenerative changes within the knee joint.
