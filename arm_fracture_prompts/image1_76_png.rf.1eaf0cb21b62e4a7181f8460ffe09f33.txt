The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the distal phalanx in the toe, indicated by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is a notable alignment issue, with signs of potential angulation at the fracture site, which may require further orthopedic evaluation. Additionally, the presence of metallic fixation pins suggests prior surgical intervention for stabilization of the fracture.
