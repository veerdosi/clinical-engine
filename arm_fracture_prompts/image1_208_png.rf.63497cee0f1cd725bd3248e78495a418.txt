The provided image shows a lateral radiograph of the left elbow joint. There is a notable presence of an effusion as indicated by the increased radiolucency around the olecranon process, which may suggest synovitis or underlying joint pathology. Additionally, there are signs of potential malalignment in the humeroulnar and humeroradial joints, which may indicate a post-traumatic deformity or chronic condition affecting joint congruence.
