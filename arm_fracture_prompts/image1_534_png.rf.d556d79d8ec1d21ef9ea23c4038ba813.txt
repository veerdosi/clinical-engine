The radiographic image presents the left knee joint in a lateral view, demonstrating normal anatomical alignment of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Relevant findings include the presence of joint space narrowing, which may suggest the potential for osteoarthritis or other degenerative joint diseases. Additionally, any visible osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint surfaces could indicate chronic wear and tear associated with repetitive stress on the knee.
