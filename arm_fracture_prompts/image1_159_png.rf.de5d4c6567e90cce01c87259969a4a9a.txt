The X-ray images provided depict the left forearm, including the radius and ulna, in both anteroposterior and lateral views. There appears to be a notable deformity with a fracture observed in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a displacement observed at the fracture site. Additionally, minimal soft tissue swelling is evident around the fracture region, indicating probable soft tissue injury associated with the osseous disruption.
