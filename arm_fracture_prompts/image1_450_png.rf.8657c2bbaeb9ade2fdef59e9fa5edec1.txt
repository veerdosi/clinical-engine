The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left shoulder joint and proximal humerus, necessitating evaluation for any associated pathologies. Notable is the presence of a potential subacromial impingement, evidenced by a narrowing of the subacromial space which can lead to rotator cuff pathology if not addressed. Additionally, there may be signs of acromioclavicular joint degeneration, characterized by osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing, which could indicate chronic degenerative changes.
