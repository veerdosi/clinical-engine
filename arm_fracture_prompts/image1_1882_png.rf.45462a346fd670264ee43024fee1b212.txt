The X-ray image displays a left forearm with a visible metallic plate and screws, indicating previous surgical intervention, likely due to a distal radius or ulna fracture. The cortical bone appears to show signs of fracture healing, with well-defined callus formation adjacent to the fracture site. There is an absence of acute osseous abnormalities or signs of infection associated with the implanted hardware.
