The X-ray image demonstrates the left shoulder joint, showing a clear delineation of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and associated bony structures. Notable is the presence of an irregularity at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may indicate a potential rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome. Additionally, the acromion appears to have reduced space underneath it, suggestive of possible subacromial bursitis or impingement-related changes.
