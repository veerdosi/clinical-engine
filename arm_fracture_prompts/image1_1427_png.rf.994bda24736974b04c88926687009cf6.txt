The X-ray image reveals an anteroposterior view of the distal humerus, where an orthopedic implant is prominently observed. There is a presence of a fixation plate with multiple screws positioned to stabilize a fracture, indicating a surgical intervention for a previous bone injury or instability. Surrounding the hardware, there is potential evidence of callus formation, suggesting a healing response, though the integrity of the surrounding bony structures should be closely evaluated for any complications.
