The X-ray image depicts a left forearm with a visible fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a distinct line suggesting a transverse or oblique pattern. There is accompanying soft tissue swelling observed around the fracture site, indicating a possible hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the distal and proximal bone segments is disrupted, suggesting instability in the fracture, which may require further assessment for potential surgical intervention.
