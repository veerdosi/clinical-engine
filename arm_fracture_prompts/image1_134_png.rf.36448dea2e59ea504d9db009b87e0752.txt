The X-ray image displays a left forearm with a noticeable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a break in continuity of the cortical bone. Additionally, signs of possible osteopenia are observed, indicated by reduced bone density in the surrounding osseous structures. The alignment and angulation of the fractured fragments suggest potential displacement, warranting further evaluation for appropriate management.
