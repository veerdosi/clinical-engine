The provided X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, highlighting potential abnormalities in both the humerus and the radius/ulna. Notably, there is an observed displacement of the humeral capitellum, which may suggest the presence of an elbow dislocation or significant joint instability. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion indicated by the presence of radiolucent areas adjacent to the joint space, which may point towards underlying inflammatory or traumatic processes affecting the elbow.
