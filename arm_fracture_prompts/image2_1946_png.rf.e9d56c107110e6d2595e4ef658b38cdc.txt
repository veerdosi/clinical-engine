The X-ray image displays an anatomic view of the right shoulder joint, with visible metallic fixation devices in place. The presence of the plate and screws indicates a history of surgical intervention, likely related to a fracture or instability of the proximal humerus. Surrounding the metallic hardware, there may be signs of callus formation indicative of the healing process, but further evaluation would be necessary to assess the condition of the surrounding soft tissues and bone integrity.
