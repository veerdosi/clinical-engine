The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the left hand, showcasing the distal phalanges, proximal phalanges, and metacarpal bones. There is a notable appearance of possible osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, particularly evident at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Additionally, the presence of a potential fracture can be observed in the distal phalanx of the middle finger, indicated by visible irregularities in bone contour and alignment.
