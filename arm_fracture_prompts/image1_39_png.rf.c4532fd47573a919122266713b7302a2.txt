The X-ray images presented show the right hand, specifically the phalangeal regions of the index and middle fingers. Notably, there is the presence of a malalignment in the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicative of possible subluxation or dislocation that could suggest a specific injury to the surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, the presence of periosteal reaction around the affected areas may be indicative of underlying inflammatory processes or bony trauma, warranting further clinical evaluation.
