The X-ray image illustrates the phalanges of the hand, indicating a possible fractured proximal phalanx of the index finger. There is evidence of joint misalignment, potentially suggesting a dislocation at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed adjacent to the area of concern, raising suspicion for an inflammatory response.
