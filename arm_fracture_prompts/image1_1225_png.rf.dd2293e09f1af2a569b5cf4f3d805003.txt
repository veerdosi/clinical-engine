The X-ray image reveals the left hand, showing both the carpal and metacarpal bones clearly. There is notable displacement and/or angulation observed in the proximal phalanx of at least one digit, which may suggest a potential fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion around the metacarpophalangeal joint, indicating possible inflammatory conditions or trauma-related changes.
