The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating an unusual alignment and presence of a metallic fixation device, suggestive of a previous surgical intervention. Notably, there is evidence of a distal humeral fracture with associated displacement, as indicated by misalignment at the elbow joint. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue structures appear to be intact, without visible signs of acute effusion or extensive periosteal reaction.
