The x-ray imaging of the hand reveals a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a typical fracture line extending across the cortical bone. Additionally, there is evidence of possible scaphoid involvement, indicated by a lucent area near the proximal carpal row, suggesting a potential scaphoid fracture or avascular necrosis. Furthermore, the alignment of the carpal bones appears maintained, with no signs of dislocation or significant degenerative changes noted in the joints.
