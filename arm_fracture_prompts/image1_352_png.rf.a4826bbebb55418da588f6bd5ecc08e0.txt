The image displays an X-ray of the forearm, showcasing the radius and ulna bones in a lateral projection. Notable in the radiograph is the presence of a well-defined fracture line located in the shaft of the radius, accompanied by localized soft tissue swelling indicative of a possible hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the radial and ulnar bones appears compromised, suggesting a potential malalignment or angulation at the fracture site.
