The X-ray image displays the right wrist, highlighting the distal radius and ulnar bones. Notable is the presence of a dorsal angulation of the distal radius, suggestive of a Colles' fracture. Additionally, there appears to be soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may indicate associated trauma or injury.
