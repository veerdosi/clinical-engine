The X-ray image exhibits a right hand with a focus on the phalangeal regions. There is a noticeable angulation and potential malalignment of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, suggesting a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling around the metacarpophalangeal joint may indicate inflammation or trauma in the surrounding structures.
