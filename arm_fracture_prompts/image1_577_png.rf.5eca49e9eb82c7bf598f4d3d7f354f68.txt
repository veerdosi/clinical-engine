The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the humerus, indicating possible displacement in the proximal region. There is a notable presence of periosteal reaction and potential cortical disruption, suggesting the possibility of an acute fracture or underlying pathology. Adjacent soft tissue structures may show swelling or effusion, indicating a response to trauma or inflammatory processes in the area.
