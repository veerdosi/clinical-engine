The image displays an X-ray of the left forearm, specifically visualizing the radius and ulna. Notably, there is significant periosteal reaction observed along the midshaft of the radius, suggesting a possible underlying pathological process. Additionally, the joint space at the distal radioulnar joint appears preserved, with no evident effusion or fracture lines visible in the surrounding bony structures.
