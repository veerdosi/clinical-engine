The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder, showcasing the glenohumeral joint, along with adjacent bony structures including the humerus, clavicle, and scapula. There is evident radiolucency surrounding the proximal humerus, suggesting the presence of a potential fracture or osteolytic lesion, which warrants further investigation. Additionally, the image reveals metallic artifacts likely indicative of prior surgical intervention or hardware placement, which may complicate the assessment of surrounding osseous integrity.
