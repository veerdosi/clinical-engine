The X-ray image demonstrates an apparent malunion of the distal radius, characterized by a misalignment at the fracture site. Intramedullary fixation is visible, indicating previous surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture, but there is evidence of callus formation suggesting ongoing healing. Additionally, the joint space appears preserved, but there may be potential signs of post-traumatic changes or degenerative alterations near the fracture site.
