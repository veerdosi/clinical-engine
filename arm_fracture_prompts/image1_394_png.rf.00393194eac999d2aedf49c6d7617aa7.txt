The X-ray displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable is the presence of a significant joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency around the olecranon and coronoid processes, which may suggest an inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, there is evidence of potential bony irregularities that could indicate an osteophyte formation or other degenerative changes within the joint.
