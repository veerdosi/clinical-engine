The image depicts a lateral view of the right knee joint, revealing significant joint space narrowing, which may suggest osteoarthritis. There is also evidence of possible osteophyte formation along the margins of the femur and tibia, indicative of degenerative changes. Additionally, a radiolucent area is observed near the femoral condyle, raising suspicion for a possible osteochondral lesion or subchondral cyst.
