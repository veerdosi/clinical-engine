The X-ray reveals a left shoulder joint with a visible humeral head and proximal humerus. There is an intramedullary rod present, which may indicate a previous surgical intervention for a fracture fixation in the humerus. The surrounding soft tissue and joint alignment appear within normal limits, but further evaluation may be warranted to assess bone density and any signs of osteolysis or infection near the surgical hardware.
