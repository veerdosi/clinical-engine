The X-ray image displays the right lower limb, specifically the femur, patella, tibia, and fibula. There is an observable misalignment between the femur and tibia, indicating a potential angular deformity, which may be indicative of conditions such as genu varum or genu valgum. Additionally, there is evidence of subluxation at the knee joint, suggesting possible joint instability or prior trauma to the area.
