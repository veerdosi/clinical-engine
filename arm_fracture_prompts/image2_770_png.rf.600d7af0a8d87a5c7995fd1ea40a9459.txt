The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing significant joint effusion characterized by the presence of increased radiolucency around the olecranon region. There is notable osteoarthritis evident, indicated by the presence of joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, primarily affecting the articular surfaces of the humerus and radius. Additionally, the radial head appears eroded, suggesting possible chronic joint instability or previous trauma resulting in degenerative changes.
