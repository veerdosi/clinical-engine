The image presents an X-ray of the right arm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna. There is a notable fracture observed in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a transverse fracture line with some displacement of the bone fragments. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, indicating a likely associated hematoma or contusion.
