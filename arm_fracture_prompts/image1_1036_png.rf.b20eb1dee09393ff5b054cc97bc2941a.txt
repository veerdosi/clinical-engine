The X-ray image displays the right hand in a standard anteroposterior view, illustrating the bony anatomy of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a distal phalanx fracture in one of the fingers, characterized by cortical disruption and potential displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, joint alignment is partially maintained; however, there is an indication of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggestive of inflammatory changes.
