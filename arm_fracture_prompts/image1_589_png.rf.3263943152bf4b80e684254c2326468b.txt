The X-ray image depicts the left forearm with visible hardware, suggesting prior surgical intervention, likely for fracture fixation. There is a well-defined metallic plate and accompanying screws securing the fragments of the radius and/or ulna, indicative of a complex fracture pattern. Additionally, there may be signs of callus formation around the fracture site, reflecting the healing process post-surgery.
