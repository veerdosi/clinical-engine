The x-ray image demonstrates an apparent fracture of the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. Additionally, there is notable periosteal reaction, indicating a possible underlying inflammatory process associated with the fracture. The alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears to be intact, suggesting the fracture may be isolated without significant displacement or angular deformity.
