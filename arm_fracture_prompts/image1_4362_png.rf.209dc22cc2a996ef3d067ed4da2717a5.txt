The X-ray image demonstrates a displaced fracture of the distal phalanx of the fifth digit (little finger), characterized by a notable angular deformity at the fracture site. There is clear disruption of the cortices, indicating a complete fracture, with involvement of both the dorsal and volar aspects of the bone. Soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture indicates possible contusion and inflammation, which is commonly associated with acute fractures.
