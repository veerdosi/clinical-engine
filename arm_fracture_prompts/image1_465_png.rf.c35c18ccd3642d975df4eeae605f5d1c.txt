The X-ray image depicts the right hand, specifically visualizing the distal phalanges and the proximal phalanges of the fingers. There is a noticeable deviation in the alignment of the phalangeal bones, which may indicate a possible deformity such as a malalignment or dislocation. Additionally, any signs of joint effusion or osteophyte formation would warrant further evaluation for conditions such as arthritis or other degenerative joint diseases.
