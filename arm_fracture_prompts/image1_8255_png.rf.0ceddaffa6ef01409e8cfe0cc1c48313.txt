The x-ray demonstrates a right humerus with the presence of an intramedullary nail, indicative of surgical intervention for a fracture stabilization. There is observed cortical disruption along the mid-shaft of the humerus, suggesting a previous fracture. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be noted, which could indicate the bodyâ€™s healing response to the underlying bony injury.
