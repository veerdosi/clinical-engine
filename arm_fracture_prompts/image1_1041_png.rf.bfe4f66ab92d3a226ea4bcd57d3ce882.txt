The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, showing the presence of an internal fixation device, likely a plate and screws, aligned along the humeral and/or radial aspect of the joint. There is evidence of a previous bony union, indicated by the callus formation around a distal humerus fracture or relating to a surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. No acute fractures are visible in the current image, but the presence of hardware suggests a prior surgical repair for a significant mechanical disruption of the osseous structures in the elbow region.
