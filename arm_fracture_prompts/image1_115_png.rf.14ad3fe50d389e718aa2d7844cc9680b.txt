The X-ray image depicts the left humerus and proximal radius and ulna, with notable deviation from normal anatomical alignment. There is an evident fracture line in the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone, which may indicate a comminuted or angulated fracture. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, suggesting the presence of a hematoma and potential soft tissue injury associated with the bony trauma.
