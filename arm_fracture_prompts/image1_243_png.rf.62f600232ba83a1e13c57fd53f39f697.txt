The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the elbow joint, demonstrating a notable alignment of the humerus and the radius and ulna. There is observable joint effusion, indicative of possible synovitis, which may suggest inflammatory processes occurring within the joint capsule. Additionally, signs of osteophyte formation are present at the margins of the joint, consistent with degenerative changes often associated with osteoarthritis.
