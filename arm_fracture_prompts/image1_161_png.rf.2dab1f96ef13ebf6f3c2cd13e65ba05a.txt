The X-ray image depicts the left hand with a focus on the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notable findings include signs of potential osteoarthritic changes, such as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis in the interphalangeal joints, indicative of degenerative joint disease. Additionally, there is evidence of possible bony deformity in the proximal phalanx, warranting further investigation for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory joint disorders.
