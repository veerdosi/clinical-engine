The X-ray reveals a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, with a notable fracture through the distal radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone structure. There is also evidence of possible avascular necrosis impacting the lunate bone, demonstrated by altered radiolucency indicating a loss of normal contour and density. Additionally, signs of potential arthritis in the carpal joints may be observed, as reflected by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
