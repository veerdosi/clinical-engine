The X-ray image displays the left forearm, presenting both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the midshaft region of the radius, characterized by a disruption in continuity, with surrounding soft tissue swelling indicated by increased radiolucency. Additionally, the alignment of both the radius and ulna appears compromised, which may suggest potential complications such as malunion or nonunion if not appropriately managed.
