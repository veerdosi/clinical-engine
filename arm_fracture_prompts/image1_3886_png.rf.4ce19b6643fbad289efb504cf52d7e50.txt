The X-ray image demonstrates the bony anatomy of the shoulder complex, including the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is evidence of an acromioclavicular joint separation, indicated by the displacement of the clavicle from the acromion process of the scapula. Additionally, mild subluxation of the glenohumeral joint is observed, which may suggest instability in the shoulder complex.
