The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder and upper arm, highlighting the humerus, scapula, and proximal radius. There is evidence of a potential fracture or displacement present in the humerus near the surgical neck, which may indicate a humeral neck fracture. Additionally, the joint alignment appears altered, suggesting possible rotator cuff pathology or glenohumeral joint instability.
