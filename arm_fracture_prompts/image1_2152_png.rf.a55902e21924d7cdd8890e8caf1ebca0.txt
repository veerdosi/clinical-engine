The X-ray image demonstrates the right shoulder joint, highlighting the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, there are signs of degenerative changes, possibly indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subtle subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there may be soft tissue swelling or effusion surrounding the joint, which could suggest an inflammatory process or underlying rotator cuff pathology.
