The X-ray image reveals an enlargement of the proximal phalanx of the fourth finger, suggestive of a possible deformity or bony abnormality. There is a notable soft tissue swelling around the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, which may indicate an inflammatory process such as tenosynovitis or arthritis. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing, possibly reflective of degenerative joint disease, warranting further clinical correlation for a definitive diagnosis.
