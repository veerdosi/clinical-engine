The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral articulation and the proximal humerus. There is evidence of glenohumeral joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the glenoid cavity, potentially suggestive of underlying pathology such as bursitis or rotator cuff tear. Additionally, signs of degenerative changes, including possible osteophyte formation at the acromioclavicular joint, are observed, which may indicate osteoarthritis of the shoulder complex.
