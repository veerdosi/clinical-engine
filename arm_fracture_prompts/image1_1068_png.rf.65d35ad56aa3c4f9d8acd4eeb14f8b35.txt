The image displays a lateral radiograph of the left elbow joint, prominently illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an evident fracture involving the olecranon process of the ulna, characterized by displacement or angulation, which may suggest a significant injury. Edema surrounding the fracture site is visible, indicating possible soft tissue involvement or hematoma formation associated with the traumatic event.
