The X-ray image depicts the left humerus with marked angular deformity, suggestive of a significant malunion or nonunion in the mid-shaft region. There is also evidence of cortical thinning and irregularity, which may indicate underlying osteopenic changes or previous trauma. The joint surfaces appear congruent, with no evident signs of acute fracture or dislocation in the glenohumeral joint.
