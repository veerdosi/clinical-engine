The X-ray image depicts a right hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. A noticeable fracture is identified in the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there may be signs of malalignment at the fracture site, suggesting a potential displacement of the fractured fragment.
