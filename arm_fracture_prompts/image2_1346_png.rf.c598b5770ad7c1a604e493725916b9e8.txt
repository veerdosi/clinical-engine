The X-ray image reveals the left forearm post-reduction, indicating prior trauma that may have necessitated orthopedic intervention. There is evident malalignment of the distal radius, suggesting possible fracture or previous corrective surgery associated with a distal radial fracture. Additionally, the proximal carpal bones appear intact, with no signs of acute pathology such as joint effusion or soft tissue swelling.
