The image presents an anteroposterior X-ray view of the left wrist, revealing multiple fractures across the distal radius and ulna. There is the presence of an internal fixation device, which appears to stabilize the fractured segments and facilitate the healing process. There is evidence of potential callus formation at the fracture site, indicating the biological response to the injury.
