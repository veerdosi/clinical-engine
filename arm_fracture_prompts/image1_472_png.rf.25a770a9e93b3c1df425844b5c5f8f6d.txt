The X-ray image shows the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is a moderate amount of joint space narrowing, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage. Additionally, osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint surfaces is observed, suggesting chronic joint changes consistent with degenerative joint disease.
