The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, highlighting a significant angulation deformity at the distal radius, consistent with a fracture. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicative of acute inflammatory changes associated with the injury. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears normal, suggesting no concurrent injuries to the wrist joint.
