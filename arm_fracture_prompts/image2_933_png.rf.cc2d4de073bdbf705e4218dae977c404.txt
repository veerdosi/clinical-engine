The X-ray image displayed is of the right forearm, showcasing the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and altered radiolucency in the region. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be suggested by the increased radiographic density around the fracture site, indicating a possible contusion or localized hematoma.
