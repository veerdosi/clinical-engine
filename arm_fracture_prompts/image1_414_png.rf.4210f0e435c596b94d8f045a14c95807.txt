The X-ray depicts the right elbow joint in a lateral view, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is noticeable radiolucency in the area surrounding the joint, which may suggest changes consistent with osteoarthritis or a soft tissue pathology. Additionally, there is an apparent osseous irregularity at the capitellum that raises concern for potential osteochondral injury or joint effusion.
