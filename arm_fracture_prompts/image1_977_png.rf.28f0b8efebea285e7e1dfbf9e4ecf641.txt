The X-ray image shows the long bones of the forearm, specifically the radius and ulna. There is evidence of cortical irregularity and a possible fracture line noted in the midshaft region of the radius, indicating potential trauma or injury. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue may demonstrate signs of edema, suggesting an inflammatory response to the observed injuries.
