The X-ray image reveals the right hand, showing the skeletal structure and alignment of the bones in the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is a foreign object, consistent with an embedded piece of material located near the distal phalanx of one of the fingers, which may indicate a foreign body reaction. There are no visible fractures or acute bony abnormalities, but the presence of the foreign object warrants further evaluation for potential soft tissue or bone involvement.
