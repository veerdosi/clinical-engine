The X-ray depicts the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella, illustrating the knee joint. There is evidence of joint effusion suggestive of possible intra-articular pathology, which could include conditions such as synovitis or hemarthrosis. Additionally, the alignment of the joint appears altered, indicating potential maltracking of the patella or underlying osteoarthritis changes at the joint space.
