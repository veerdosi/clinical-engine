The X-ray reveals a right leg view, showcasing the femur, tibia, and fibula in their anatomical positions. Notably, there appears to be an angular deformity in the tibia, suggestive of a possible torsional or angulation deformity, which could indicate conditions such as bowing or post-fracture malunion. Additionally, there is an observable increase in soft tissue density around the knee joint, which may suggest associated edema or localized inflammatory changes.
