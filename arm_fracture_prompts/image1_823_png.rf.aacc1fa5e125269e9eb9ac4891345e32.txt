The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the left elbow with signs of an unstable joint alignment. Notably, there is the presence of a metallic implant, indicating prior surgical intervention, possibly for internal fixation or stabilization of the fractured bone. Evidence of callus formation is observable around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process, however, there may be concerns regarding the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues.
