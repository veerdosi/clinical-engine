The X-ray image reveals multiple phalangeal bones of the right hand, showcasing a potential fracture in one of the distal phalanges, evidenced by a visible disruption in the cortical bone. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the affected digit, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury or contusion. The alignment of the remaining phalanges appears intact, with no signs of dislocation or joint subluxation present in the visualized areas.
