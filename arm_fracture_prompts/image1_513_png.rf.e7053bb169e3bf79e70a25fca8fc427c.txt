The X-ray image displays the right humerus, demonstrating a notable fracture at the mid-shaft region. There is evidence of significant displacement of the fracture fragments, indicating a possible comminuted fracture pattern. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit signs of edema, suggesting associated soft tissue injury adjacent to the fracture site.
