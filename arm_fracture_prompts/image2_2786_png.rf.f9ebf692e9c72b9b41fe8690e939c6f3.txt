The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint with notable changes suggestive of a proximal humeral fracture. There appears to be displacement of the humeral head, consistent with possible surgical neck fractures or fractures involving the greater tuberosity. Additionally, joint space narrowing may indicate associated hemorrhage or soft tissue edema, further highlighting the potential for complications such as avascular necrosis or rotator cuff injury.
