The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, with particular attention to the wrist joint. Notable observations include an apparent fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone and possible alignment issues. Additionally, there are visible signs of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, which may indicate an inflammatory process such as synovitis or associated soft tissue injury.
