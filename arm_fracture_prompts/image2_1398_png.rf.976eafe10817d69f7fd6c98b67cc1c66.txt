The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus, with particular attention to the glenohumeral joint and surrounding soft tissues. Evidence of potential degenerative changes may be noted in the form of bone spurs or irregularities along the articular surfaces, suggestive of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be signs of subacromial impingement, indicated by altered bone morphology in the acromial region, which could correlate with impingement syndrome.
