The image displays a lateral view of the left hand, with particular attention to the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable findings include possible signs of an abnormality in the metacarpophalangeal joint, which may suggest joint effusion or inflammatory changes. Additionally, there is evidence of potential bony lesions or irregularities in the bone cortex, warranting further evaluation for possible osteochondral involvement.
