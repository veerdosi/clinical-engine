The X-ray image displays the left knee joint, highlighting the distal femur and proximal tibia, which are aligned appropriately in a typical anatomical position. There is evidence of joint effusion characterized by an increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar pouch, suggesting possible inflammatory processes or trauma. The femoral condyles and tibial plateau appear congruent, without visible fractures or obvious osteophytic changes, indicating the absence of advanced osteoarthritis.
