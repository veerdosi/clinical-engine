The X-ray image presents an anterior-posterior view of the right knee joint, revealing significant abnormalities around the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by an irregularity in the soft tissue adjacent to the joint capsule, which may suggest inflammatory processes. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes at the joint margins may point to degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
