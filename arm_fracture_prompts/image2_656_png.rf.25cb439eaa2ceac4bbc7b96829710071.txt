The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the humerus, with notable alignment of the bone structures. There is evidence of a possible malunion at the surgical site, characterized by irregular cortical contours and bone resorption in the metaphyseal region. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear distended, which may indicate the presence of an underlying inflammatory process or hematoma.
