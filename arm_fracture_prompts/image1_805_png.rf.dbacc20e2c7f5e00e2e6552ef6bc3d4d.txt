The X-ray image illustrates a right knee joint with well-defined anatomical structures, including the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the presence of increased radiolucency around the patellofemoral joint, suggesting a possible underlying synovitis or traumatic injury. Additionally, there is a subtle deformity observed in the alignment of the femorotibial joint space, which may be indicative of an angular deformation, such as genu valgum or genu varum, warranting further clinical correlation.
