The X-ray image depicts the left upper extremity, specifically focusing on the humerus, ulna, and radius in a flexed position. There is evident disproportionate angulation of the bone structures, suggesting a potential malalignment, which may indicate a pathological condition. Additionally, subtle signs of periosteal reaction are visible, raising concern for possible underlying osteomyelitis or stress-related injury adjacent to the bone cortex.
