The X-ray image of the left knee joint demonstrates the presence of joint effusion, which may indicate underlying synovitis or trauma. Notably, there is a potential osteophyte formation at the margins of the femoral condyle, suggestive of osteoarthritis. The alignment of the distal femur and proximal tibia appears intact, without signs of acute fracture or dislocation.
