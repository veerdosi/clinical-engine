The X-ray image shows an anterior-posterior view of the forearm, including the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. There is evidence of a significant fracture affecting the midshaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and possible angulation deformity. Additionally, there is joint effusion observed in the elbow region, potentially indicating associated soft tissue damage or inflammatory processes.
