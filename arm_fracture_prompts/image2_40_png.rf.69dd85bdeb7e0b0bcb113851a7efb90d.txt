The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable is the presence of a significant angular deformity at the mid-forearm region, suggestive of a possible malalignment or developmental anomaly. Additionally, the osseous structures appear to exhibit changes consistent with osteopenia, which could indicate diminished bone density in the surrounding areas.
