The X-ray image displays the left femur in the lateral view, showing a significant deformity characterized by an abnormal curvature along the diaphysis. There are visible metallic implants noted along the shaft of the bone, suggestive of prior surgical intervention or fixation related to a fracture or osteotomy. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema or other abnormalities that cannot be directly assessed through the X-ray but can be inferred from the deformity observed.
