The image presents a bilateral radiograph of the wrists, clearly labeled with "R" for right and "L" for left. Both wrist joints exhibit characteristic alignment of the proximal and distal carpal bones, as well as the radiocarpal joint space. Upon review, there may be subtle signs of joint effusion or changes suggestive of possible tenosynovitis in the surrounding soft tissues, which should be further evaluated.
