The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the forearm, showing both the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, with displacement indicated by a separation at the fracture site. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the bones appears intact, with no significant signs of edema or abnormal calcification.
