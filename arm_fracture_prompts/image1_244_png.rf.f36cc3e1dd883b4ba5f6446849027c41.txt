Notable is the presence of joint effusion characterized by a radiolucent area adjacent to the joint space, suggestive of potential inflammatory conditions. Additionally, there are signs of osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, indicating possible degenerative changes associated with osteoarthritis.
