The X-ray image presents a right knee joint with evidence of internal fixation, including a plate and multiple screws, indicating previous surgical intervention for an osteosynthesis procedure. There is notable alignment of the distal femur and proximal tibia, suggesting a history of a fracture that required stabilization. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable with no signs of acute complications such as effusion or osteomyelitis visible in this projection.
