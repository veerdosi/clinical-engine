The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the hand, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable findings include potential deformities in the distal phalanx of the thumb, which may indicate a fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is an abnormal alignment of the proximal interphalangeal joints that could suggest the presence of a ligamentous injury or arthritic changes.
