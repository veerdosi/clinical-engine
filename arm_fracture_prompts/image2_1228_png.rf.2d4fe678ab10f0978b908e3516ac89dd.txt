The X-ray image depicts the forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna bones. There appears to be a disruption in bone continuity, suggestive of a possible fracture in the distal radius, with potential angulation or displacement evident. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present around the fracture site, indicating an accompanying soft tissue injury or hematoma.
