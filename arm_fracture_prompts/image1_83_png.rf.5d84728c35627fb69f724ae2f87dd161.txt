The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, specifically showing the radius and ulna. Notably, there appears to be a prominent fracture in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a complete break with potential displacement. The ulna shows no evident fractures but may exhibit signs of associated soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site.
