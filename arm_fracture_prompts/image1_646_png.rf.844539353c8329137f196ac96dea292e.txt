The radiographic image demonstrates the skeletal structure of the right hand, specifically evaluating the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable is the presence of a possible fracture in the proximal phalanx of the third digit, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, the alignment of the metacarpophalangeal joints suggests potential misalignment, which may indicate an underlying ligamentous injury or instability.
