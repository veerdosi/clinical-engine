The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable observations include joint space narrowing indicative of potential osteoarthritis, with subchondral sclerosis evident in the femoral condyles. Additionally, there is a presence of osteophytes that may suggest degenerative joint disease affecting the articulating surfaces.
