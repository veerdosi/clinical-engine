The provided image shows an X-ray of the right knee joint, illustrating an operative fixation device. The presence of metallic hardware suggests previous surgical intervention, likely related to the treatment of a fracture in the distal femur or proximal tibia. Notably, there are signs of potential joint effusion surrounding the knee, which may indicate intra-articular pathology such as synovitis or an underlying injury.
