The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by disruption of the cortical outline and potential involvement of the surrounding soft tissues. There are signs of current periosteal reaction, indicative of a healing process or ongoing stress response in the bone. Joint alignment appears to be preserved in the metacarpophalangeal joint, although careful evaluation is required to rule out concurrent ligamentous injuries or complications.
