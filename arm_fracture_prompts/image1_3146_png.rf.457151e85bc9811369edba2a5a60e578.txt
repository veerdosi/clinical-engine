The X-ray image displays a radiographic view of the distal femur and proximal tibia, showcasing a surgical fixation device, likely a plate and screws, applied to stabilize a fracture. The alignment of the bone fragments appears to be maintained, indicating a surgical intervention aimed at promoting appropriate healing of the fracture site. Notably, the presence of metal hardware suggests a previous operative procedure for internal fixation, potentially following an intra-articular or peri-articular fracture involving the knee joint.
