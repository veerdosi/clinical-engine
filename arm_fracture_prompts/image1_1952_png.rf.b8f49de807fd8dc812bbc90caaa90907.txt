The X-ray image displays the bony architecture of a human hand, revealing the phalangeal bones and metacarpals in their anatomical arrangement. Notably, there appears to be a cortical disruption at the base of the fifth metacarpal, suggestive of a potential fracture. Additionally, there may be soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected area, which could indicate an inflammatory response typically associated with trauma.
