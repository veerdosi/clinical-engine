The image presents an X-ray of the left shoulder, capturing the humerus and the surrounding bony structures, including the clavicle and scapula. Notably, there is evidence of a surgical intervention, indicated by the presence of metallic fixation devices, suggesting previous fracture management or stabilization. Signs of degenerative joint disease or glenohumeral arthritis may be observed, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, which could indicate chronic changes in the articular surface.
