The X-ray depicts the right humerus, with notable assessment of the diaphysis and the distal end near the elbow joint. There is evidence of a localized osteolytic lesion in the midshaft region, which could indicate potential pathological changes such as a bone tumor or osteomyelitis. Additionally, there is a slight deformity or angulation observed in the bone contour, suggesting possible malalignment or a prior fracture that may not be properly healed.
