The image depicts a lateral X-ray view of the patient's left forearm, showing the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a non-union fracture at the distal radius, characterized by a cleft between the fractured ends. Additionally, there appears to be signs of osteopenia in the surrounding bone structure, indicating a decrease in bone mineral density.
