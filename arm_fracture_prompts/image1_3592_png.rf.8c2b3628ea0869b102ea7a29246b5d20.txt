The X-ray image demonstrates a surgical fixation device applied to the proximal humerus, indicating a history of fracture in that area. Multiple screws are seen securing a plate along the lateral aspect of the humeral shaft, indicative of an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. The presence of the fixation device suggests an attempt to stabilize the fracture for proper healing and to restore functional anatomy.
