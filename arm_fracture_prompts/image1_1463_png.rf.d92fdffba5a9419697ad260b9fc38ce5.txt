The image illustrates a right lower extremity radiograph demonstrating the postoperative alignment of the distal tibia and fibula. There is a visible presence of a healing fracture at the distal fibula, characterized by callus formation indicative of the body's reparative process. In addition, the alignment of both the tibia and fibula appears to be stabilized, reflecting the outcome of a surgical reduction procedure aimed at correcting malalignment due to previous fracture displacement.
