The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint in a lateral view, illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna in relation to one another. There is notable displacement at the elbow joint, suggesting the presence of an acute fracture or dislocation involving the humeral trochlea and the olecranon of the ulna. Soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the joint region, which could indicate associated hematoma or inflammation.
