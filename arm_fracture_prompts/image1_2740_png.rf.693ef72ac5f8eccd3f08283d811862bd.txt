The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, revealing notable intramedullary fixation devices indicating a prior surgical intervention. There is evidence of a previous fracture, likely in the distal radius area, with callus formation observed, suggesting the healing process is underway. Additionally, there is joint involvement at the distal radioulnar joint, which may indicate potential complications or sequelae associated with the injury.
