The X-ray image of the right hand showcases a partial fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit, characterized by a transverse fracture line that is evident in the mid-shaft region. There is also notable cortical disruption and potential displacement, indicating a significant compromise to the anatomical integrity of the bone. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the affected area may suggest associated contusion or hematoma formation, which is commonly seen in acute traumatic injuries.
