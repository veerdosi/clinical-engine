The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left hand, revealing the phalangeal bones and their articulations at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by the degradation of cartilage and subsequent bone changes. Additionally, there are visible signs of soft tissue swelling, potentially indicative of an inflammatory process or trauma to the surrounding structures.
