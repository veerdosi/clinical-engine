The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, specifically illustrating the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There is evidence of joint effusion and potential synovial hypertrophy in the periscapular region, which may indicate inflammatory arthropathy or another underlying pathology. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes along the humeral head is suggestive of osteoarthritis, warranting further evaluation for joint stability and functionality.
