The X-ray image demonstrates the right humerus and forearm, including the radius and ulna, with clear visibility of the joint spaces at the elbow and wrist. An observable fracture is noted in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a transverse alignment and cortical disruption, suggesting a significant injury. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate the presence of a hematoma or inflammation in response to the trauma.
