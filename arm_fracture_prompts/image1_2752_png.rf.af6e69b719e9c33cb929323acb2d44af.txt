The X-ray image displays an elbow joint with the presence of a metallic fixation device, indicating a previous surgical intervention. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal humerus, which is typically accompanied by potential complications such as malunion or nonunion. The alignment of the olecranon and the distal radius appears disrupted, suggesting possible post-traumatic changes or instability within the joint complex.
