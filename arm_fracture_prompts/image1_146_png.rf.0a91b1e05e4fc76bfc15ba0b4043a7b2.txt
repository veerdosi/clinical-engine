The X-ray depicts a left hand in an oblique position, revealing the presence of an intramedullary pin fixation in the distal radius, suggesting prior surgical intervention for a fracture. Notably, there is an angulation deformity of the middle phalanx of the index finger, which may indicate previous trauma or malalignment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is absent around the finger joints, indicating a potential stable post-operative condition.
