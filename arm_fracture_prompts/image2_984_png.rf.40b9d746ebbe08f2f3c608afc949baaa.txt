The provided x-ray image shows a right forearm with notable radiolucent lines indicating possible non-displaced fractures of the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of cortical thinning, suggesting osteoporosis or osteopenia in the affected bones. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears slightly altered, which may indicate a deformity or malunion, warranting further investigation.
