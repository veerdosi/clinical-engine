The X-ray image showcases the lateral view of both hands, highlighting the skeletal structure of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notable is a potential fracture evident in the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit on the left hand, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortex and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Further, there is an observable alignment issue in the fourth and fifth digits, suggesting a possible deviation or deformity that may require further evaluation.
