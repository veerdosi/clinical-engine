The X-ray image depicts a left femur with a noticeable deformity characterized by a midshaft fracture exhibiting angulation. There is evidence of callus formation at the fracture site, indicating the healing process, while the surrounding soft tissue appears to exhibit mild swelling. Additionally, the presence of cortical bone irregularities may suggest underlying conditions such as osteopenia or prior trauma affecting bone density and integrity.
