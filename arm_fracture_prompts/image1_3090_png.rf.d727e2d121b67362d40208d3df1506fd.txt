The X-ray image displays a left wrist (indicated by "L") with evidence of a surgical fixation device, suggesting a history of fracture repair. The presence of metallic hardware, such as plates and screws, indicates a previous intervention for stabilizing the fracture, likely within the distal radius or ulnar region. There is also potential visibility of any residual bone deformity or malunion adjacent to the fixation site, characteristic of a traumatic injury that necessitated surgical correction.
