The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna in an anteroposterior view. There is evidence of a transverse fracture across the midshaft of the radius with associated cortical disruption and surrounding soft tissue edema, indicating acute injury. Additionally, there is no evident joint effusion at the elbow joint, and the alignment of the bones appears intact, with no signs of malunion or nonunion at this time.
