The X-ray image demonstrates the phalangeal bones of the fingers, revealing a distinct presence of a metallic foreign body situated across one of the distal phalanges. There is evidence of a possible fracture line at the site of the foreign body, indicating a potential osseous injury. Surrounding soft tissue may also exhibit signs of edema, consistent with acute inflammatory responses associated with trauma or foreign body presence.
