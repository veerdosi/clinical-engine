The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the forearm, illustrating both the radius and ulna. There is a clear sign of a transverse fracture present in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a clean break that may indicate acute trauma. Additionally, signs of potential periosteal reaction can be observed, suggesting recent bone injury and localized inflammation in response to the fracture.
