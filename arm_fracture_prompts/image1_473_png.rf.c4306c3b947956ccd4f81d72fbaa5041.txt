The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal bones and the metacarpophalangeal joint. There is notable joint space narrowing in the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is potential subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation, suggestive of degenerative changes in the surrounding bone structures.
