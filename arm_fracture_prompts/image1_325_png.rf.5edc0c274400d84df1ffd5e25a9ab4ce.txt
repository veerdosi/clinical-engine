The image displays an X-ray of the forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an acute angulated fracture of the distal radius, characterized by significant displacement and malalignment. Additionally, joint involvement at the wrist suggests possible complications related to the fracture, requiring further evaluation for soft tissue damage or associated ligamentous injury.
