The X-ray image displays the right hand in an oblique view, highlighting the phalangeal regions and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a possible presence of a deformity in the proximal phalanx of the thumb, characterized by an angular deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Signs of osteoarthritis may be suggested due to the presence of joint space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation, particularly around the first carpometacarpal joint.
