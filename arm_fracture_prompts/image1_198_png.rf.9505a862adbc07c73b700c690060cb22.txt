The X-ray image reveals a possible fracture of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. There is also notable edema in the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site, indicating potential trauma or an inflammatory response. Additionally, joint alignment appears intact at the distal radioulnar joint, with no signs of dislocation or significant deformity evident in the surrounding structures.
