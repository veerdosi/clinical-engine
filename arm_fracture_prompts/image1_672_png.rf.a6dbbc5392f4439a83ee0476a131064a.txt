The X-ray image depicts the humerus and adjacent structures of the upper extremity in a lateral view. There is evidence of a fracture line observed in the mid-shaft of the humerus, which may indicate a diaphyseal fracture. Additionally, the periosteal reaction noted along the medial aspect suggests possible inflammatory changes, warranting further evaluation for underlying pathologies.
