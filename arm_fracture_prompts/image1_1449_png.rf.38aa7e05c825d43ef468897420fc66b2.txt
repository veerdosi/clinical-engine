The X-ray image demonstrates a post-operative appearance of the distal radius, where metallic fixation devices, including plates and screws, are observed, indicating prior surgical intervention. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radial region, characterized by altered alignment and displacement, consistent with instability. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present, inferred by the obscured details surrounding the wrist joint, which is often associated with traumatic injuries.
