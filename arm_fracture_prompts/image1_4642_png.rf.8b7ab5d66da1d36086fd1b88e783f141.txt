The X-ray image displays a left knee joint with the presence of internal fixation devices, indicating a prior surgical intervention in the region. There is evidence of metallic hardware, including a plate and screws, which suggest a history of fracture fixation likely involving the femur or tibia. There are no signs of acute displacement or significant malalignment, but the surrounding soft tissues should be evaluated for any signs of inflammation or complications related to the surgical procedure.
