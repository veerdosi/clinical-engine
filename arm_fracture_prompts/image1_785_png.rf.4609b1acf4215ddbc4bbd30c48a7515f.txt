The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding soft tissue structures. Notably, there is evidence of a possible humeral head irregularity, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis or a rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the absence of a well-defined joint space could indicate joint effusion or a degenerative change within the shoulder joint.
