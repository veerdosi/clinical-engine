The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and associated with localized edema in the surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, there is a noticeable dorsal angulation at the fracture site, which is indicative of a possible Colles' fracture, commonly associated with wrist injuries. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, and there are no signs of intra-articular involvement or additional fractures within the imaging field.
