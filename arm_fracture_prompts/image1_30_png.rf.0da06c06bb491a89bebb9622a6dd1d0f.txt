The X-ray image depicts a right forearm with notable deformities in the radius and ulna. There is a discernible mid-shaft fracture of the radius, accompanied by a potential fracture line in the ulna, leading to malalignment between the two bones. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling are evident surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate the presence of associated hematoma or inflammation.
