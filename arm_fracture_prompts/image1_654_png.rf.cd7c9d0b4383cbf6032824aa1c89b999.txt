The provided X-ray image reveals an incomplete fracture of the left humerus, characterized by a radiolucent line indicating disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There appears to be associated soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, which may suggest the presence of a hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral head with respect to the glenohumeral joint appears compromised, indicating potential dislocation or subluxation.
