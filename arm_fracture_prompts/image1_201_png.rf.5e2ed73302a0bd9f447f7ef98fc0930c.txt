The radiograph displays the lateral view of the wrist, revealing significant radiolucency in the distal radius, suggesting an acute fracture. Notable is the angulation at the fracture site, indicative of a possible distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears disrupted, raising suspicion for associated soft tissue injury or joint instability in the wrist complex.
