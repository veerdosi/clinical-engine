The X-ray image demonstrates multiple phalangeal bones of the left hand, specifically highlighting the second digit. There is evidence of a fracture through the middle phalanx, which shows a disruption in cortical continuity and possible displacement. Additionally, joint effusion may be indicated at the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting inflammation or trauma in the surrounding soft tissue structures.
