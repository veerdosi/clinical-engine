The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones of the wrist. There is notable irregularity in the bony architecture, specifically within the carpal region, suggestive of either osteoarthritis or a malalignment of the carpal bones. Additionally, there may be increased radiolucency around the carpal joint, indicating possible degenerative changes or bone cyst formation.
