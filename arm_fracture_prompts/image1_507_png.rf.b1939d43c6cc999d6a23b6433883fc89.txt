The X-ray image presents an oblique view of the left wrist, demonstrating the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture through the distal radius, characterized by an irregular alignment and a visible fracture line, suggesting a possible acute injury. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue edema may be inferred, indicating potential inflammatory changes associated with the fracture.
