The X-ray image depicts the left ulna and radius, with clear visualization of both bones in the forearm. Notably, there are signs of a possible fracture in the radial shaft, characterized by a disruption in the cortices and alignment of the bone. Additionally, there may be indications of a bony abnormality, with some widening in the area adjacent to the fracture, potentially suggesting a callus formation or other healing response in the surrounding periosteum.
