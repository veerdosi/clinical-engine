The X-ray image displays the bony anatomy of a human hand, showcasing the phalanges, metacarpals, and the carpal bones in a lateral view. Notable radiopacity in the metacarpal region may indicate a possible fracture or bony pathology, necessitating further evaluation for any associated displacement or involvement of adjacent soft tissues. Additionally, there appears to be a misalignment in the proximal interphalangeal joints that could suggest a potential degenerative process or previous injury not clearly defined in the current imagery.
