The X-ray images display the right wrist and forearm in multiple projections. There is evidence of a fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by displacement and possible angulation, which suggests an acute injury. Additionally, signs of early osteoarthritic changes are noted in the wrist joint, including joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
