The radiographic image depicts an anteroposterior and lateral view of the right wrist and distal forearm. Notable findings include a possible fracture of the radial bone, characterized by irregular bony margins and slight displacement. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, suggesting a potential hematoma or inflammatory process in the surrounding structures.
