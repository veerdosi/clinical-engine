The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the knee joint, revealing the presence of a surgical fixation device, indicative of an internal fixation procedure, likely for a fracture. The medial femoral condyle shows signs of repositioning, which is characteristic of a previous fracture-repair intervention. There is a notable osteosynthesis plate applied to stabilize the fractured components, with accompanying metallic screws, which suggests an operative management of a complex knee fracture.
