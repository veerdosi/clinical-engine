The X-ray image presents a left hand with visible bone structures, showing the phalanges of the digits as well as the metacarpals. Notably, there appears to be a misalignment of one of the phalangeal joints, suggestive of a potential angular deformity or malalignment of the digit. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no obvious signs of edema or joint effusion present in the evaluated areas.
