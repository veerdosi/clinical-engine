The X-ray image displays the right wrist and forearm, clearly showing the carpal bones, distal radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of an angular deformity of the distal radius, which may indicate a malalignment or fracture. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the joint appears increased, suggesting potential edema or inflammation consistent with trauma or localized pathology.
