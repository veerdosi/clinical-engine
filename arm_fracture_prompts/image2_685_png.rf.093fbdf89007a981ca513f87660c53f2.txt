The X-ray image depicts the left forearm in a lateral view, revealing an apparent fracture in the mid-shaft of the ulna. Noteworthy is the presence of callus formation, indicating a healing response to the cortical disruption at the fracture site. Additionally, there is a potential alignment issue suggestive of malunion, as the relationship between the ulna and adjacent radius appears compromised.
