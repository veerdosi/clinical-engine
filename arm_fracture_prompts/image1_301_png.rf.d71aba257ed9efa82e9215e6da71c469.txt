The x-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus. There is significant cortical disruption noted, with surrounding soft tissue edema that suggests a potential hematoma formation. Additionally, alignment of the humeral head appears intact, indicating that the joint structures may not be affected by the fracture.
