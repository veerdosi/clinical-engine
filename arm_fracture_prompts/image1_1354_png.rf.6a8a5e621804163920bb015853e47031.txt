The X-ray image of the left shoulder reveals evidence of a possible rotator cuff tear, characterized by discontinuity or retraction of the associated tendons. Additionally, there is a notable presence of acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation. Lastly, there are signs of subacromial impingement, as demonstrated by the positional relationship of the humeral head relative to the acromion.
