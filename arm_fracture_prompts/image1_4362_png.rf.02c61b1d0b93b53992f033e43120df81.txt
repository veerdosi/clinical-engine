The x-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left hand, showing notable changes in the phalangeal region. There is the presence of a fracture line crossing through the distal phalanx, indicating structural compromise of the bone integrity. Additionally, there are signs of potential callus formation suggesting a healing process at the fracture site, reflecting an ongoing biological response to the injury.
