The X-ray image demonstrates a significant valgus deformity of the knee joint, characterized by an abnormal lateral angulation of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing and potential subchondral sclerosis indicative of osteoarthritis changes, particularly affecting the medial compartment of the knee. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes along the articular surfaces further suggests chronic degenerative changes within the joint.
