The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right wrist, revealing the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notable is the presence of a cortical discontinuity in the distal radius, which suggests a possible fracture that may be impacting adjacent soft tissues. Furthermore, there are slight alterations in the alignment of the carpals, indicative of potential ligamentous injury or joint instability.
