The radiograph displays an anteroposterior view of the left hand, with a focus on the proximal phalanx of the thumb. There is evidence of a fracture through the mid-diaphysis of the proximal phalanx, characterized by displacement and cortical disruption. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted adjacent to the injury site, indicating a possible associated soft tissue injury or hematoma.
