The X-ray image displays a notable angulation of the distal radius, indicative of a possible distal radius fracture. There is evidence of cortical disruption at the fracture site, and associated soft tissue swelling may suggest the presence of a hematoma. The overall alignment of the forearm bones is compromised, warranting further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as malunion or nonunion.
