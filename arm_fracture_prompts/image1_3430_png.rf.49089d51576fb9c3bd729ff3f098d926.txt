The X-ray image displays the right hand, providing a clear view of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of osteoarthritic changes, including joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis particularly in the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there appears to be a malalignment in the second digit, suggestive of a possible deformity such as a boutonni√®re or similar condition affecting the extensor mechanism.
