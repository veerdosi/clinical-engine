The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, providing a clear view of the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Notable is the presence of glenohumeral joint degeneration, indicated by joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation along the glenoid. Additionally, there may be signs of rotator cuff pathology, such as changes in the humeral head position or subacromial impingement.
