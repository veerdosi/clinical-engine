The X-ray image shows the phalanges of the hand, with a focus on the first digit (thumb) and the surrounding metacarpal bones. Notable within the image is a potential avulsion fracture at the proximal phalanx of the thumb, characterized by a small bony fragment that has separated from the main structure. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion within the carpometacarpal joint, suggesting possible inflammatory changes or injury.
