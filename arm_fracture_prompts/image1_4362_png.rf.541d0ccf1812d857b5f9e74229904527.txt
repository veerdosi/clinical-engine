The X-ray reveals a transverse fracture of the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by a clear break in the bone continuity. There is evidence of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate an associated injury. Additionally, alignment of the phalanx appears disrupted, suggesting potential implications for joint function and stability.
