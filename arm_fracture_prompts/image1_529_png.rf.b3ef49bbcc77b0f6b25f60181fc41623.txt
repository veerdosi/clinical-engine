The X-ray images display the left forearm, highlighting the ulnar and radial bones along with the proximal carpal bones. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and potential displacement, indicating a possible fragility or traumatic injury. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears compromised, which may suggest associated ligamentous injury or instability within the wrist joint.
