The X-ray image displays three views of the left wrist, revealing significant bony abnormalities. Noteworthy findings include an irregular contour of the distal radius, suggestive of an osteochondral lesion, which may indicate degenerative changes. Additionally, there appears to be a loss of joint space at the radiocarpal joint, potentially indicative of post-traumatic arthritis or synovitis.
