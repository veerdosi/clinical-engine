The X-ray image displays the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and the metacarpal bones. There is evidence of joint space narrowing at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, slight subchondral sclerosis is observed, suggesting increased stress at the joint interface, commonly seen in degenerative joint disease.
