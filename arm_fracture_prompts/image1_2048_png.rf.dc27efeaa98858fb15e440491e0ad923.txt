The X-ray image depicts an elongation of the diaphysis of the humerus with a notable angulation at the midsection, potentially indicating a pathological or traumatic deformity, such as a fracture. There is a visible disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting a periosteal reaction which may signify recent trauma or stress. Joint effusion may also be observed around the elbow joint, indicating possible associated injuries or inflammatory processes affecting the joint structures.
