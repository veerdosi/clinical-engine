The X-ray image depicts the right hand, displaying well-defined bony structures of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notable is the presence of apparent osteopenia, characterized by a reduction in bone density, which may suggest an underlying condition affecting bone mass. Additionally, joint spaces appear normal with no signs of arthritic changes or acute fractures evident in this view.
