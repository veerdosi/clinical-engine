The X-ray image displayed illustrates the left shoulder joint, revealing a potential separation at the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Notably, there is evidence of a possible acromioclavicular joint dislocation, characterized by an abnormal alignment and possible elevation of the clavicle relative to the acromion. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, which could suggest associated rotator cuff pathology or impingement.
