The X-ray image reveals the left wrist and forearm, showcasing both the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible displacement of the distal radius, indicative of a possible Colles' fracture, characterized by dorsal angulation. Additionally, the carpal bones appear intact, but there may be concerns for associated soft tissue swelling or ligamentous injury evident in the surrounding structures.
