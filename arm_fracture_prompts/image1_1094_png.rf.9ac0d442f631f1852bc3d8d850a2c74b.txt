The X-ray image demonstrates the left shoulder region, prominently displaying the glenohumeral joint and the surrounding bony structures, including the humeral head, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, the image reveals signs of degenerative joint disease, characterized by joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and potential osteophyte formation around the glenoid cavity. Additionally, there appears to be an irregularity at the acromioclavicular joint, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis or an acute/subacute injury, warranting further clinical correlation.
