The image displays a series of radiographs of the left forearm, showing the ulna and radius bones. There are evident cortical disruptions along both the radius and ulnar shafts, indicating diaphyseal fractures, which may present with varying degrees of angulation or displacement. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, suggesting the potential for non-displaced fractures at the distal ends of the radius and ulna.
