The X-ray image displays a right shoulder joint with a visible shoulder arthroplasty, indicated by the presence of a humeral stem and a glenoid component. Notable observations include the alignment of the prosthetic components, with no signs of periprosthetic fracture or dislocation evident in the surrounding structures. Additionally, there is a lack of significant osteolysis or soft tissue swelling, suggesting stable positioning of the implant without acute inflammatory changes.
