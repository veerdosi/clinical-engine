The X-ray image reveals a left shoulder joint with visible changes indicative of degenerative joint disease, commonly known as osteoarthritis. There is a notable joint space narrowing between the humeral head and the glenoid fossa, alongside the presence of osteophytes, suggesting the development of bone spurs. Additionally, there may be evidence of subchondral sclerosis, which is characterized by increased bone density beneath the cartilage, often associated with chronic joint stress and degeneration.
