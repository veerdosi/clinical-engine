The X-ray demonstrates a significant angulation of the distal phalanx in the fourth digit of the hand, indicative of a possible malalignment or fracture. The joint spaces appear narrowed at the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting potential degenerative changes or inflammatory arthropathy. Additionally, there is an observable increase in soft tissue swelling around the affected digit, which may reflect an underlying inflammatory process or trauma.
