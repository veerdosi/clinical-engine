The X-ray image displays a right wrist with an internal fixation device, indicating the presence of surgical intervention. There is evidence of a healed fracture in the distal radius, characterized by callus formation and alignment restoration. Adjacent to the fracture site, there may be visible signs of mild cortical thickening, suggesting post-operative changes or remodeling of the bone.
