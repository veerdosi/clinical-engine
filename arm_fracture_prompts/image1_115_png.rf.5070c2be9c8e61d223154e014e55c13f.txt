The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the left humerus, characterized by a distinct disruption in the cortical integrity of the bone. Additionally, there is notable periosteal reaction, suggesting potential ongoing inflammation or healing processes at the fracture site. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no evidence of joint effusion or significant soft tissue edema observed in the vicinity of the injury.
