The X-ray image demonstrates a left forearm complex, including the radius and ulna, with notable evidence of a diaphyseal fracture in the distal third of the radius. There is also significant soft tissue swelling observed around the fracture site, suggestive of potential trauma-related hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears compromised, indicating possible associated complications such as malalignment or instability.
