The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the shoulder complex, highlighting the humeral head and the glenohumeral joint. There is a noticeable irregularity in the contour of the humeral head, suggestive of osteophyte formation or a possible degenerative change consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, which may indicate impingement syndrome or rotator cuff pathology.
