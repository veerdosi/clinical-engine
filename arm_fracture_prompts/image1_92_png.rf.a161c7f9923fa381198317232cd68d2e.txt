The X-ray image demonstrates a clear view of the humerus, radius, and ulna in the upper extremity. Notably, there is an angular deformity present in the diaphysis of the radius, indicative of potential fractures or malalignment. Additionally, the joint space at the elbow appears to be normal without any significant effusion or signs of degenerative joint disease.
