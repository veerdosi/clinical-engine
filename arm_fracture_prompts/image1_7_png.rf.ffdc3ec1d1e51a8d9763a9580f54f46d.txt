The X-ray depicts the right forearm in an anteroposterior view, exhibiting a significant fracture of the radius characterized by a comminuted type. Notably, there is alignment disruption between the distal and proximal segments of the radius, suggesting a pathological alteration in the bone integrity. Additionally, signs of potential soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site may indicate underlying hematoma or edema commonly associated with traumatic injuries.
