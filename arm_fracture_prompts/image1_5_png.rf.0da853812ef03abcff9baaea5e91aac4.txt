The X-ray image shows an articulated view of the left elbow, displaying both the humerus and the radius and ulna in their anatomical positions. Notably, there is a visible fracture line at the distal radius, characterized by displacement and angulation, which is indicative of a potential incomplete or complete fracture. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, suggesting an associated soft tissue injury or trauma.
