The X-ray image displays the right forearm with a focus on the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a significant cortical disruption in the mid-shaft of the radius, suggesting a potential fracture, characterized by a radiolucent line through the bone cortex. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction, which may indicate an inflammatory process surrounding the affected bone.
