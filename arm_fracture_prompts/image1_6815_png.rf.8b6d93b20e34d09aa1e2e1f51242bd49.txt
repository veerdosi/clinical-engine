The X-ray image presents a right shoulder with partial glenohumeral dislocation, evidenced by the displacement of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity. There is also cortical irregularity noted around the humeral head, which may indicate associated bony changes or trauma. Additionally, joint effusion is suggested by the radiolucency observed in the perjoint soft tissue, potentially indicating inflammatory processes or injury in the surrounding structures.
