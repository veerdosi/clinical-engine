The X-ray image presents the left forearm, showcasing the ulna and radius bones in a lateral view. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone integrity, with potential displacement. Additional soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site may indicate a contusion or hematoma, often associated with acute traumatic injury.
