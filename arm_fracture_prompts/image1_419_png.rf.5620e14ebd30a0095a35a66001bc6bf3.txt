The x-ray image displays a lateral view of the left tibia and fibula, highlighting the overall cortical integrity of the bones. There is an apparent distortion in the alignment of the shaft of the tibia, suggestive of a possible angular deformity, which may indicate a previous trauma or congenital condition. The proximal and distal ends of both bones present with normal osseous characteristics, with no visible signs of fractures or lesions noted in this particular view.
