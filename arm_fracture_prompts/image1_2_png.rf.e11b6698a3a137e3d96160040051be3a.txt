The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the elbow joint, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notably, there is a presence of joint effusion in the elbow, indicated by the enlargement of the joint space, suggesting possible underlying inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or bursitis. Additionally, slight angulation of the ulna is observed, raising considerations for a potential deformity or malalignment affecting the normal biomechanics of the elbow joint.
