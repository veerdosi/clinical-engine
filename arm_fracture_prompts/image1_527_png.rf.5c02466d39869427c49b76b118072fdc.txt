The X-ray image displays the left wrist in three projections: anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique views. Notable findings include an irregularity at the distal radius, suggesting a possible fracture or malalignment, accompanied by soft tissue swelling. There is also evidence of an associated joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, indicative of potential traumatic injury or inflammatory pathology.
