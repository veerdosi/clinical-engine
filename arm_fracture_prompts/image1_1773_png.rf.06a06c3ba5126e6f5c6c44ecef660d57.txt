The X-ray image displays a clenched fist configuration, revealing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notably, the scaphoid and lunate bones are well-defined, and there is an apparent alignment of the distal radius and ulna. There are no visible signs of fractures or dislocations in the bones; however, any soft tissue swelling or abnormalities are not discernible in this radiographic view.
