The X-ray image reveals the left shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Notably, there is evidence of a potential humeral head dislocation, as indicated by the misalignment and positioning relative to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, there is a presence of periarticular osteophyte formation suggestive of osteoarthritis in the glenohumeral joint region.
