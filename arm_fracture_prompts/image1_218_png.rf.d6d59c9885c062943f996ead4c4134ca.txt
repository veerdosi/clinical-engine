The X-ray image displays the humeral head and the proximal radius, with a clear visualization of the joint space. Notably, there is an irregularity in the contour of the articular surface of the humeral head, which may suggest the presence of osteophytes associated with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a slight decrease in joint space, indicative of potential degenerative changes within the glenohumeral joint.
