The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the index finger in a lateral view, showcasing the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. There is a notable presence of a fracture in the middle phalanx, characterized by a distinct line through the cortical bone, indicating a disruption of osseous continuity. Additionally, there appears to be slight displacement at the fracture site, which may affect the alignment of the digit and potentially lead to complications in functionality if not properly managed.
