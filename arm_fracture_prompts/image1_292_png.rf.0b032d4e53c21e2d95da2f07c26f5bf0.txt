The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna. There is an observable mid-shaft fracture of the radius manifesting with a clear fracture line, indicating a complete disruption of the cortical bone integrity. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted adjacent to the fracture site, which may suggest associated hematoma or edema in response to the injury.
