The X-ray demonstrates a left forearm, revealing both the radius and ulna with adequate structural visibility. Evidence of a clear fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius is present, characterized by a sharp disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there are signs of potential soft tissue swelling indicated by the periosteal reaction around the fracture site, suggestive of an acute injury.
