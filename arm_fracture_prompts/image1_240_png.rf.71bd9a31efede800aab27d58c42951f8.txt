The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the hand, clearly depicting the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a presence of osteophytes at the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may suggest a degenerative joint condition such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be increased radiolucency surrounding the second and third metacarpal bones, which could indicate a potential cystic lesion or localized osteopenia.
