The X-ray image presents an examination of the proximal humerus and glenohumeral joint. Notable findings include a potential humeral head fracture, characterized by irregular cortical margins that signify discontinuity in the bony structure. Additionally, there is evidence of possible joint effusion as suggested by increased radiolucency around the glenohumeral joint space, indicating an underlying pathological process such as arthritis or trauma.
