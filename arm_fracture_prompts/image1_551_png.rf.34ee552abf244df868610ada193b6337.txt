The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left wrist, demonstrating normal alignment of the metacarpals and phalanges. There is evidence of an abnormality in the wrist joint, specifically a potential fracture in the scaphoid, which is commonly associated with wrist trauma. Additionally, there appears to be surrounding soft tissue edema, potentially indicating acute inflammatory changes in response to the identified fracture.
