The X-ray image demonstrates significant deformation of the distal phalanx with angulation, which may indicate a potential fracture or malalignment. The presence of an abnormal contour in the osseous structures suggests possible bony growth or osteophyte formation. Additionally, there is a visible soft tissue swelling, raising the suspicion for associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory process surrounding the affected area.
