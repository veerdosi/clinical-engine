The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the right knee joint, with the femur, tibia, and fibula visible. Notably, there is a potential angular deformity present in the distal femur or proximal tibia, which may suggest varus or valgus malalignment. Additionally, the joint space appears to be narrowed, indicating possible degenerative changes or osteoarthritis within the knee.
