The x-ray shows an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity. There is also associated soft tissue swelling that may suggest hematoma formation in the periosteal region. Alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, but there is potential displacement of the fracture fragment, indicating a possible instability of the injury.
