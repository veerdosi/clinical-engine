The X-ray image displayed demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. The bone alignment appears normal, but there is noticeable joint space narrowing within the medial compartment, which may suggest early signs of osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is no evidence of acute fractures or significant bone lesions observed in the visualized areas.
