The X-ray image demonstrates the upper skeletal structure, highlighting the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus. Notably, there appears to be a displacement of the acromioclavicular joint, suggesting a possible acromioclavicular joint separation. Additionally, the contour of the humeral head may indicate signs of osteophyte formation, potentially consistent with degenerative changes in the shoulder joint.
