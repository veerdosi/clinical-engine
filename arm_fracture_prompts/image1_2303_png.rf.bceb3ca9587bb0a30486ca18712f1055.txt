The X-ray image reveals a significant angulation and displacement of the distal radius, indicative of a distal radius fracture. There are also clear signs of malalignment at the wrist joint, highlighting the associated injury to the ulnar styloid process. Additionally, the presence of metallic hardware suggests prior surgical intervention for stabilization, likely due to the complexity of the fracture pattern.
