The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and the proximal humerus. Notably, there is the presence of a metallic orthopedic implant in the region, indicative of possible previous surgical intervention for fracture fixation or joint reconstruction. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, although slight osteopenia may be inferred based on the bone density observed in the humerus and scapula.
