The image exhibits a radiographic view of the right hand, showcasing the skeletal anatomy of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable enlargement and deformity of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit suggest possible pathophysiology, likely indicative of a condition such as digital osteoarthritis or inflammation. Additionally, joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joint may be observed, which is consistent with degenerative joint disease processes.
