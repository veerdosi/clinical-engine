The x-ray image of the right wrist shows an abnormal alignment of the carpal and distal radius bones, indicative of potential osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis changes. There is notable joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the radiocarpal joint, suggesting degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes may point towards chronic inflammation or joint degeneration affecting the articulating surfaces.
