The radiographic image displays a lateral view of the hand, highlighting the phalangeal and metacarpal structures. Notable findings include potential osteoarthritic changes at the distal interphalangeal joints, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected joints, suggestive of inflammation or effusion.
