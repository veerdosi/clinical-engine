The X-ray image demonstrates a right lower leg with an intramedullary nail utilized for internal fixation, indicating a history of tibial fracture. The alignment of the bone appears to be restored, as evidenced by the nail's position along the diaphysis of the tibia, with the periosteum likely intact. No signs of nonunion or malunion are apparent at this stage, and the surrounding soft tissues show no significant abnormalities.
