The X-ray image displays the right forearm including the radius and ulna, with clear visualization of the distal and proximal ends of both bones. There is evidence of cortical disruption in the midshaft of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture, while the ulna appears intact with normal bone density. The alignment of the bones is altered at the fracture site, suggesting a malalignment characteristic of a displaced fracture.
