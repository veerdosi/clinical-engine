The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the knee joint, revealing a significant joint space narrowing indicative of degenerative changes, likely consistent with osteoarthritis. There is also evidence of subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation, which are common findings associated with chronic joint degeneration. Additionally, the alignment of the femur, tibia, and fibula appears to be intact, with no visible fracture or dislocation noted in the examined region.
