The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the forearm, prominently featuring a metallic plate and screws positioned along the midshaft of the radius, indicative of surgical fixation. There is evidence of a comminuted fracture in the radius, characterized by multiple fragments at the fracture site. The surrounding soft tissues appear to be intact, although there may be signs of callus formation, suggesting an ongoing healing process in the fractured bone.
