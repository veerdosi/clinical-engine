The X-ray depicts the left wrist and forearm, highlighting the carpal bones, distal radius, and ulna. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical outline and adjacent soft tissue swelling. Additionally, joint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis may indicate early degenerative changes or osteoarthritis within the wrist.
