The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left elbow, demonstrating the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. There is notable angulation of the ulna, suggesting a possible deformity, such as cubitus varus or "gunstock deformity," characterized by an inward angling at the elbow joint. Additionally, joint spaces appear maintained, but the surrounding soft tissue may indicate potential edema or inflammation, which requires further evaluation.
