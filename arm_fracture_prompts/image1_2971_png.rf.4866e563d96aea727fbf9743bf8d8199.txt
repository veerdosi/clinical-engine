The X-ray image depicts the radiographic anatomy of the right wrist joint, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and proximal phalanx structures. There is notable joint effusion observed within the radiocarpal joint space, which may suggest underlying inflammatory or traumatic pathology. Additionally, signs of osteophyte formation at the margins of the distal radius and proximal ulna are indicative of degenerative joint disease, potentially consistent with osteoarthritis.
