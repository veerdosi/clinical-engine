The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of a human hand, clearly displaying the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of osteolytic lesions in the distal phalanx of the index finger, which may indicate underlying pathology such as a localized infection or a neoplastic process. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed, suggestive of possible degenerative changes or early signs of arthritis in the affected areas.
