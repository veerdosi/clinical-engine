The X-ray demonstrates an incomplete fracture of the proximal humerus, evident by the disruption in cortical continuity with associated soft tissue edema. Additionally, there appears to be an acromioclavicular joint involvement, potentially indicating an acromioclavicular joint separation. The alignment of the glenohumeral joint is maintained, but minor malalignment may suggest underlying ligamentous instability, warranting further clinical correlation.
