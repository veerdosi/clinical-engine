The X-ray image displays a right wrist with evidence of an orthopedic implant, specifically a plate and screws, which suggest previous surgical intervention. There is notable disruption of the distal radius, indicative of a complete fracture that has undergone internal fixation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears preserved, with no signs of secondary osteoarthritic changes in the observed joint spaces.
