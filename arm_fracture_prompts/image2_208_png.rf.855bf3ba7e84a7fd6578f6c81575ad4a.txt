The x-ray depicts an orthopedic fixation device, specifically a plate and screws, affixed to the diaphysis of a long bone, likely the femur or humerus. The presence of the metallic hardware indicates a history of a fracture that required surgical intervention for stabilization and alignment. No evidence of bone union or significant callus formation is noted around the fixation device, which could suggest nonunion or delayed healing of the fracture.
