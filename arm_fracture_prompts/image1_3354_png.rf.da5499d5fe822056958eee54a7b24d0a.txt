The radiographic image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing the presence of a rigid internal fixation device, indicative of a surgical intervention due to an unstable fracture. Notably, there is evidence of osseous irregularity surrounding the distal humerus, suggesting potential callus formation as part of the healing process. Additionally, there may be soft tissue swelling evident adjacent to the elbow, which could signify post-surgical edema or inflammation.
