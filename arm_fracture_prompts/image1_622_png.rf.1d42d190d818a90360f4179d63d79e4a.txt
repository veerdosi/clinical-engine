The x-ray image shows the knee joint with two prominent metallic screws indicative of recent surgical intervention, likely involving an osteosynthesis procedure. There is evidence of a fracture involving the distal femur and proximal tibia, as the alignment of the bone structures appears compromised. Additionally, there may be signs of post-surgical changes, such as edema or callus formation around the fracture site, which could indicate ongoing healing processes post-operatively.
