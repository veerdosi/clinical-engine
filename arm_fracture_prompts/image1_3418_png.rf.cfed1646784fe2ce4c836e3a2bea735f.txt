The x-ray image displays the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal bones of the fingers. There is a notable presence of potential deformities in the distal phalanges, which may indicate conditions such as malunion or nonunion of the phalangeal fractures. Additionally, the overall alignment and joint spaces may suggest degenerative changes or other underlying pathologies that could affect the function of the hand.
