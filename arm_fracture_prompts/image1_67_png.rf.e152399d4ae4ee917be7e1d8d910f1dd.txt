The X-ray image displays the right hand, focusing on the proximal and distal phalanges as well as the metacarpals of the fingers. Notable findings include a possible phalangeal fracture with displacement, evident by a discontinuity in the cortex and an abnormal alignment of the involved digit. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling adjacent to the injury site, suggestive of associated trauma.
