The image presents an X-ray of the left forearm, demonstrating radiolucent lines suggesting a fracture in the distal radius and possibly the ulnar styloid process. Notably, there is significant callus formation evident around the fracture site, indicating an attempt at healing. Additionally, there are signs of cortical thinning in the surrounding bone, which could suggest underlying osteoporotic changes.
