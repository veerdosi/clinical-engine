The X-ray image displays an anterior-posterior view of the forearm, illustrating the radius and ulna bones. There is a noticeable angulation at the mid-shaft of the radius, suggestive of a possible diaphyseal fracture, which may indicate a recent traumatic event. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site is evident, which could be indicative of an associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
