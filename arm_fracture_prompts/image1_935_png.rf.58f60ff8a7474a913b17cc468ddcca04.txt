The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right hand, illustrating the bony structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is an absence of acute fractures; however, mild osteoarthritis can be inferred from the joint spaces, particularly in the interphalangeal joints. The bone density appears within normal limits, with no evidence of osseous lesions or significant abnormalities evident in the surrounding soft tissues.
