The X-ray image demonstrates the right hand and wrist in an anteroposterior view, revealing the alignment and integrity of the carpal bones. Notable abnormalities include the presence of joint space narrowing and potential signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by subchondral sclerosis and marginal osteophyte formation. Additionally, there is a visible deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may suggest an underlying condition affecting joint architecture.
