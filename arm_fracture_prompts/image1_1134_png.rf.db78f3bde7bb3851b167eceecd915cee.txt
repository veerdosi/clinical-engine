The X-ray demonstrates the distal radius and ulna with potential cortical disruption observed in the distal radius. There is evidence of a possible fracture or significant trauma to the radial bone, characterized by a break in the cortical continuity. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, suggesting no immediate dislocation at the wrist joint; however, further evaluation may be required to assess ligamentous integrity.
