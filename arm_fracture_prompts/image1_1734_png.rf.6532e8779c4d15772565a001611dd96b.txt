The X-ray image displays a notable angular deformity at the elbow joint, characterized by potential malalignment of the distal humerus and proximal radius. This may suggest the presence of cubitus varus, commonly associated with a "gun stock" deformity, indicated by an abnormal carrying angle. Additionally, there is a possible joint effusion at the elbow joint, which can often be indicative of underlying inflammatory conditions or trauma to the joint structures.
