The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, revealing a notable anterior angulation of the distal radial shaft. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture with cortical disruption, characterized by a complete fracture traversing the bone, indicating a potential case of instability. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed, which may suggest associated hemorrhage or inflammatory response in the periosseous region.
