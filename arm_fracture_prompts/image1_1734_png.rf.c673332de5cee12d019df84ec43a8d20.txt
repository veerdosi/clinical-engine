The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical outline and associated displacement. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, indicative of periosteal reaction or hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, suggesting that there is no associated carpal dislocation at this time.
