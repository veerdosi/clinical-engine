The X-ray image displays the shoulder joint, including the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is a notable alteration in the anatomical alignment of the glenohumeral joint, which may suggest the presence of a dislocation or glenoid labrum injury. Additionally, there are indistinct areas of radiolucency around the joint space that could indicate potential degenerative changes or soft tissue involvement.
