The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the humerus and forearm, with a notable metallic implant observed in the proximal region. There is evidence of bony alteration near the surgical site, indicating potential osteosynthesis following a fracture, as suggested by the presence of the fixation device. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no acute osseous abnormalities identified at this time.
