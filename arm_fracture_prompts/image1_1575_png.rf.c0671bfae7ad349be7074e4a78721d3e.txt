The X-ray image displays a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a complete break with displacement evident in the alignment of the bone. Additionally, there is the presence of a metallic fixation device, which suggests that an internal fixation procedure has been performed to stabilize the fracture. Surrounding soft tissues may exhibit edema or other inflammatory changes, indicated by soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site.
