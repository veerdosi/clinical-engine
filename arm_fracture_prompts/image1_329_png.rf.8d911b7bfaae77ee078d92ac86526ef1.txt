The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint, showing the presence of internal fixation hardware, indicative of a previous surgical intervention, likely for the stabilization of a fracture. There is clear evidence of bone alignment issues, potentially suggesting the presence of malunion or nonunion related to prior trauma. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be observed, which could indicate underlying complications such as osteomyelitis or stress due to abnormal mechanical loading on the bony structures.
