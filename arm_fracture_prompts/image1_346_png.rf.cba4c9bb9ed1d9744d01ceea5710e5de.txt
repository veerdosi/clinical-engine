The X-ray image demonstrates a longitudinal view of the forearm, clearly displaying both the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there appears to be a transverse fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. Additionally, minor displacement is observable, indicating a potential for instability in the fracture site that may necessitate further orthopedic evaluation.
