The X-ray image displays the left humerus with evidence of a mid-shaft fracture characterized by cortical disruption and possible overlapping fragments. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues may exhibit edema indicated by a slight haziness adjacent to the fracture site. No signs of significant displacement are observed, but the alignment of the fracture needs further evaluation for potential implications on healing and functional outcomes.
