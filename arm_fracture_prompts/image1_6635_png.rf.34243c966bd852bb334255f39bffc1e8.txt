The X-ray image reveals a potentially displaced humeral head, suggesting the presence of a shoulder joint pathology. There is a notable irregularity in the glenohumeral joint space, which may indicate a possible rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome. Additionally, there are signs of subacromial osteophyte formation, which may contribute to shoulder impingement and limited range of motion.
