The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and ulna, with notable joint space narrowing and potential subluxation at the wrist joint. There is evidence of osteophyte formation and possible periarticular calcification, which may suggest degenerative changes. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears disrupted, indicating a possible instability or deformity in the wrist region.
