The radiograph displays a right shoulder joint with abnormal morphology suggestive of a possible humeral head irregularity or deformity. There is a notable presence of subacromial spurring and possible acromioclavicular joint degeneration, which could indicate osteoarthritis of the shoulder. Additionally, the greater tuberosity demonstrates a cystic lesion, raising suspicion for potential rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
