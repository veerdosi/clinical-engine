The X-ray image displays the left forearm, comprising the radius and ulna, along with the adjacent wrist joint. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and possible angulation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the fracture site, suggesting associated hematoma formation or edema.
