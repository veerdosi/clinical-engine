The X-ray illustrates a lateral view of the distal humerus and proximal forearm. Notable is the presence of a fracture at the distal radius, exhibiting a typical dorsal angulation, which may indicate a Colles' fracture pattern. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction suggestive of a potential underlying pathologic process affecting the bone integrity or healing response.
