The X-ray image presents the right hand, showcasing multiple phalanges and metacarpals. Notable findings include potential deformities of the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may indicate conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subarticular sclerosis. Additionally, there appears to be a possible dorsal angulation of the metacarpal bones, suggestive of a fracture or post-traumatic changes, which should be evaluated in correlation with clinical symptoms for comprehensive management.
