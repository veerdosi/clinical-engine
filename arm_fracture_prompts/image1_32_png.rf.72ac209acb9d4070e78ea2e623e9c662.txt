The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the wrist and hand, revealing multiple visualized bones including the radius, ulna, and carpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by angulation and possible displacement, which is consistent with an acute injury. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the joint shows signs of edema, suggesting the presence of inflammation or hemorrhage in the area adjacent to the fracture site.
