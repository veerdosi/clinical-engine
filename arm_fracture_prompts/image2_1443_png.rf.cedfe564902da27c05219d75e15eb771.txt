The X-ray image displays an elevated position of the forearm, showing the ulna and radius in an easily distinguishable manner. Notable is a potential angular deformity at the level of the distal forearm, which may suggest a malalignment indicative of a fracture or previous skeletal injury. Additionally, there are signs of cortical thickening in the ulna, which could reflect a physiological response to abnormal mechanical loading or stress.
