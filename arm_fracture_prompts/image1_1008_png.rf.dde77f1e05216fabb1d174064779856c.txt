The X-ray image depicts the bony structures of the wrist and hand, highlighting the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is an indication of a fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, which may be characterized by cortical disruption and potential displacement. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site are present, which may suggest acute injury or inflammatory changes.
