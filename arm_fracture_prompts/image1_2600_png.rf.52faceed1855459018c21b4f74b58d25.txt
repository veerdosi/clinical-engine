The X-ray image of the left wrist reveals a fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a clearly delineated discontinuity in the bony cortex. Additionally, there is evidence of slight dorsal angulation of the distal fragment, which may indicate a Colles' fracture, common in older populations due to fall-related injuries. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, without any signs of dislocation or significant soft tissue swelling evident in the surrounding areas.
