The X-ray demonstrates a clear transverse fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a distinct disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is also evidence of adjacent soft tissue swelling, suggesting potential hematoma formation or edema related to the trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the fracture segments appears to be angulated, indicating a possible need for orthopedic intervention to restore anatomical integrity.
