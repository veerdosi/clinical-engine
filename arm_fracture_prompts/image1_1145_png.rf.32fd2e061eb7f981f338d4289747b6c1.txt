The X-ray image displays the right hand and wrist, revealing pronounced joint space narrowing, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal joints, suggestive of degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there are noticeable osteophyte formations at the distal interphalangeal joints, indicative of chronic joint degeneration. Evidence of soft tissue swelling is also observed around the wrist, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
