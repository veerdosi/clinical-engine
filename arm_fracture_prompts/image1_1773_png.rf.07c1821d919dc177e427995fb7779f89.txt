The X-ray image demonstrates a closed fracture of the distal radius, evidenced by the displacement of the bone fragments and misalignment of the surrounding anatomical structures. Notably, there is associated soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, indicative of potential contusion or hematoma formation. Additionally, the ulnar styloid process appears intact, suggesting that the fracture is primarily localized to the radial aspect of the forearm without significant involvement of the ulnar side.
