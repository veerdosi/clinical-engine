The X-ray image reveals an acute fracture of the distal phalanx of the index finger, indicated by a disruption in the normal cortical outline and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there is evidence of a small avulsion fragment at the site of the fracture, which may suggest a tendon or ligament injury. The alignment of the remaining phalanges appears intact, with no signs of dislocation or additional bony abnormalities noted in the surrounding structures.
