The X-ray demonstrates a left knee joint with an evident presence of a metallic prosthesis, indicative of total knee arthroplasty. The surrounding bony structures appear well-aligned, with no observable signs of osteolysis or periprosthetic fractures. Notably, the joint space is obscured due to the presence of the prosthetic device, suggesting potential degeneration or loss of the native cartilage.
