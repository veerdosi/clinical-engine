The radiograph demonstrates a lateral view of the thigh and knee region, showing the femur and proximal tibia. Notably, there is a visible angular deformity of the femur, indicating possible malalignment or varus/valgus deformity. Additionally, joint effusion may be suggested by the increased soft tissue opacity around the knee joint, which could indicate underlying inflammatory or degenerative processes.
