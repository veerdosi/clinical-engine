The X-ray image reveals an elbow joint with visible surgical hardware, specifically a metallic plate and screws, indicating prior intervention, likely for the fixation of a fracture. There is a notable alignment of the distal humerus and proximal ulna, although slight deviations may be present, suggesting potential malunion or misalignment post-surgery. Surrounding the hardware, there is no apparent periosteal reaction or signs of osteomyelitis, indicating a lack of acute inflammatory process at this time.
