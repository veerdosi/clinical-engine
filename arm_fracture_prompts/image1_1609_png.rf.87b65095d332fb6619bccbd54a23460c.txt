The X-ray image presents a right knee joint with a clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of an intra-articular foreign body, likely indicative of a possible retained fragment or surgical material within the joint space. Additionally, there is a notable joint effusion, characterized by an increase in soft tissue radiolucency around the knee, suggesting possible inflammation or underlying pathology.
