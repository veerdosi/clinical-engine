The X-ray image displays the distal radius and proximal carpal bones of the wrist. There is evident misalignment of the distal radius and fractures of the scaphoid and possibly the lunate, indicating a potential fracture-dislocation pattern. Additionally, joint space narrowing and surrounding soft tissue edema may suggest underlying inflammatory processes or trauma.
