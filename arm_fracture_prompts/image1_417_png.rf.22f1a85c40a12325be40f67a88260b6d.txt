The X-ray image presented shows the bony structures of the left hand, with a clear view of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there appears to be a fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity, with possible adjacent soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there are signs of osteopenia in some of the distal phalanges, suggesting a decrease in bone mineral density that may warrant further investigation.
