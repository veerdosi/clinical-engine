The image depicts a lateral view of the knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of joint effusion, as indicated by increased radiolucency around the patella, suggesting the presence of fluid accumulation within the joint space. Additionally, the articular surfaces appear congruent, but there is a potential osteochondral defect noted in the femoral condyle, which may indicate chondral pathology or an underlying injury.
