The X-ray image demonstrates an apparent angular deformity of the left humerus, characterized by excessive medial angulation at the mid-diaphysis. The elbow joint appears displaced, suggesting a potential acute dislocation or fracture with associated soft tissue swelling. There is also evidence of pericapsular calcification around the elbow, indicative of possible heterotopic ossification.
