The x-ray image depicts the right wrist joint, with clear visualization of the distal radius and ulna, as well as the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there appears to be an osseous deformity in the scaphoid bone, which may suggest a possible fracture or avascular necrosis. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, indicating potential inflammatory changes or a possible associated injury.
