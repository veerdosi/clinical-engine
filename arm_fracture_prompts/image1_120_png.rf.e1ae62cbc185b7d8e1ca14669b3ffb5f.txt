The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the hand, revealing the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a presence of osteophytes at the distal interphalangeal joints, indicating possible osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the metacarpals appears disrupted, suggestive of a potential malalignment or previous fracture.
