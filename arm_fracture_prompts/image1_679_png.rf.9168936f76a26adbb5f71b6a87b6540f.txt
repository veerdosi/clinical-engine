The X-ray image presented demonstrates the left forearm, exhibiting a clear view of the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a transverse fracture of the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a noticeable disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no evident signs of extensive hematoma or soft tissue swelling.
