The X-ray image displays the left forearm, clearly depicting both the radius and ulna. There is a notable radiolucent line across the midshaft of the radius, suggestive of a possible fracture, with accompanying periosteal reaction visible in the surrounding soft tissue. Additionally, the alignment of the bone shows significant angulation, indicating a potential deformity in the osseous anatomy.
