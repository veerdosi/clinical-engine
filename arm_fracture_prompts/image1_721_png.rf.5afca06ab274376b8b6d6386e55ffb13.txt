The X-ray image demonstrates a complete fracture of the distal radius with significant displacement suggestive of a possible distal radial fracture. There is evident shortening of the radius, and the alignment of the carpal bones appears disrupted, indicating instability at the wrist joint. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture may show signs of edema, which could suggest an acute inflammatory response typical of fracture-related injuries.
