The X-ray image captures the right hand in a standard anteroposterior view, highlighting the carpal and phalangeal bones. There is a notable presence of a possible fracture in the distal radius, indicated by a disruption in the cortical outline, which may suggest an acute injury. Additionally, joint spaces appear diminished in certain areas, suggesting a potential degenerative change such as osteoarthritis affecting the carpometacarpal joints.
