The X-ray image demonstrates a pronounced humeral head deformity, indicative of potential osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology. Notably, there is evidence of subluxation at the glenohumeral joint, which suggests compromised joint stability. Additionally, the osseous architecture shows possible sclerosis around the joint margins, often associated with chronic degenerative changes.
