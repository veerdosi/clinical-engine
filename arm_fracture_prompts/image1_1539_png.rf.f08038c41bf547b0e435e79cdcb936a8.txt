The X-ray image displays the right wrist and forearm, showing the distal radius and ulnar bones. There is an evident angulation and potential displacement of the distal radius, suggesting a possible distal radius fracture, often associated with wrist injuries. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears altered, indicating a possible injury to the carpometacarpal joints or soft tissue structures surrounding the wrist.
