The image displays a lateral view of the left knee joint, illustrating the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable changes in the joint space may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by the narrowing of the medial compartment and potential osteophyte formation at the femoral condyles. There is also evidence of subchondral sclerosis in the tibial plateau, which may indicate degenerative changes associated with chronic stress or loading on the joint.
