The X-ray image displays a longitudinal view of the right forearm, clearly visualizing both the radius and ulna. There is notable cortical interruption along the midshaft of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture, with adjacent soft tissue swelling apparent. Additionally, the alignment of the radius appears compromised, suggesting potential malalignment or deformity related to the identified fracture.
