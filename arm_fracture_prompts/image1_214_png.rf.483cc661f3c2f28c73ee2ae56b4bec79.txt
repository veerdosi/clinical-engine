The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right hand, showing the metacarpal bones, phalanges, and the carpals of the wrist joint. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and possible displacement of fracture fragments. Additionally, mild soft tissue swelling is observed around the injury site, suggesting a potential traumatic event and associated hematoma formation.
