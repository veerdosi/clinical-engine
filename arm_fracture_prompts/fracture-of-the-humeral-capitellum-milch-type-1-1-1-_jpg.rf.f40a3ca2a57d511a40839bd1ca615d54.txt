The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an irregularity at the olecranon area, which may suggest the presence of an olecranon fracture or possible post-traumatic changes. The articular cartilage appears narrowed, indicating potential degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis in the elbow region.
