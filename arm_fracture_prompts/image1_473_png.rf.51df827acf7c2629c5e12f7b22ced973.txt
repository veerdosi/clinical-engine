The X-ray image displays an anatomical view of the left foot, focusing on the toes, specifically the phalanges. Notably, there is a visible deviation of the hallux with potential signs of hallux valgus deformity, indicating lateral angulation at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Additionally, there are varying degrees of joint space narrowing observed in the interphalangeal joints, which could suggest underlying arthritic changes within the toe structures.
