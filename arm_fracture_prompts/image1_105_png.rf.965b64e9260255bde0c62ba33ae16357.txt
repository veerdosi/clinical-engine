The X-ray image demonstrates a radiolucent lesion in the distal region of the femur, suggesting the presence of a potential osteolytic process. Notably, there is evidence of cortical bone interruption, which may indicate a pathological fracture or underlying neoplastic activity. Additionally, the joint space appears preserved, but surrounding soft tissue edema may be inferred from the observed changes in the bone structure.
