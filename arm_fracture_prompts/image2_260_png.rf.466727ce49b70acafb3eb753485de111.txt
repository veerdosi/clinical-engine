The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal angulation of the humerus at the midshaft, indicative of a possible humeral fracture. There is also evidence of periosteal reaction, which may suggest a recent injury or trauma to the bone. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears swollen, potentially indicating associated hematoma or edema.
