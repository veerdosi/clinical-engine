The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the forearm, specifically highlighting the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there may be signs of displacement or angulation, indicating instability in the bony architecture, which could suggest acute traumatic injury.
