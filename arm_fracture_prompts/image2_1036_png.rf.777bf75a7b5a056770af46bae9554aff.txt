The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint, revealing a significant angulation of the humerus at the junction with the ulna and radius. There is evidence of potential olecranon involvement with observable changes that may suggest a fracture or deformity within the region. The alignment of the joint surfaces appears disrupted, indicating a possible acute or chronic condition affecting the integrity of the surrounding osseous structures.
