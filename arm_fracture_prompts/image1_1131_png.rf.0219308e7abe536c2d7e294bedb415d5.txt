The X-ray demonstrates an osteosynthesis device, specifically a plate and screws, positioned along the distal radius and proximal part of the carpal bones. There is evidence of previous fracture healing in the distal radius, characterized by callus formation and increased bone density adjacent to the metal hardware. Additionally, there appears to be alignment issues, as indicated by potential malalignment of the wrist joint relative to the distal ulna, suggesting a deformity possibly related to prior trauma or surgical intervention.
