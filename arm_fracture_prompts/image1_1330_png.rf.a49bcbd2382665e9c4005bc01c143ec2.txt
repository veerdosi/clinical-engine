The image depicts a left wrist radiograph, revealing bone alignment and joint relationships of the carpal and metacarpal regions. The scaphoid bone appears to be more prominent, suggesting the potential for avascular necrosis or a scaphoid fracture, which is a common injury in wrist trauma. Additionally, there is notable overlap of the trapezium and first metacarpal joint, indicating possible signs of degenerative joint disease or carpometacarpal osteoarthritis.
