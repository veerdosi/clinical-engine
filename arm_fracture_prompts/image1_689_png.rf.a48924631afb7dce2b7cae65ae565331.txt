The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of the right hand, demonstrating the phalangeal bones of the fingers. There are notable deformities observed in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, potentially indicating the presence of osteoarthritis or other degenerative joint disease. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion, characterized by increased radiolucency in the periarticular regions, which could suggest inflammation within the affected joints.
