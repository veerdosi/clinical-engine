The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left hand, prominently displaying a fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit (little finger). There appears to be angular deformity at the fracture site, indicating possible misalignment of the bone segments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the affected area, which could suggest associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory response.
