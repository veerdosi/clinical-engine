The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the right hand, prominently featuring the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a distal phalanx fracture in the indexed finger, characterized by a clear interruption in the cortical bone continuity and potential displacement. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling may be observed, indicating possible acute trauma or inflammation in the surrounding structures.
