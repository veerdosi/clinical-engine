The X-ray image displays both hands in an extended position, highlighting the bony structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable in the image is the presence of potential fractures, particularly in the proximal phalanges, as evidenced by irregularities in the cortical bone and altered trabecular patterns. Additionally, there is a suggestion of joint misalignment at the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may be indicative of a sprain or other soft tissue injury.
