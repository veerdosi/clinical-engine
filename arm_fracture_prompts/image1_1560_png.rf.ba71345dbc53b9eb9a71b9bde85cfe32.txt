The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint space and surrounding osseous structures. Notably, there appears to be a presence of subacromial osteophytes, suggesting the possibility of degenerative changes associated with shoulder impingement syndrome. Additionally, there is mild cortical thinning of the humeral head, indicating possible osteopenic changes or early stages of osteoarthritis within the joint.
