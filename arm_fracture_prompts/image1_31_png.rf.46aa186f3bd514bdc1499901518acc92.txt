The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right humerus, indicating a potential fracture disrupt between the proximal and mid-shaft region. There is evidence of cortical interruption suggesting a possible non-displaced or minimally displaced fracture, characterized by surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, the articulation of the elbow joint appears intact without any signs of dislocation or significant joint effusion.
