The X-ray image depicts a prominent osteophyte formation around the lateral aspect of the elbow joint, suggestive of osteoarthritis. Signs of joint space narrowing are observed between the humerus and the ulna, indicating degenerative changes. Additionally, there appears to be subchondral sclerosis seen in the distal humerus, indicating stress and potential inflammatory processes associated with chronic joint disease.
