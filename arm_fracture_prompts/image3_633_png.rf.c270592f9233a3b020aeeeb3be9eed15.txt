The X-ray image displays a notable diaphyseal fracture of the humerus, characterized by a disrupted cortex with a slight displacement. There are also visible metallic implants, suggesting recent surgical intervention, possibly for internal fixation of the fracture. The surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema, though this cannot be definitively assessed from the radiological image alone.
