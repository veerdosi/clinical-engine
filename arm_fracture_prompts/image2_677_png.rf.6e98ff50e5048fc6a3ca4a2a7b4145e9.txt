The X-ray image displays a significant deformity of the right hand, particularly affecting the proximal phalanges. Notable is the presence of subluxation of the MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joints, which may indicate a disruption of normal joint alignment and potential ligamentous injury. Additionally, there appears to be evidence of bone erosion or osteolysis in the base of the phalanges, suggestive of an underlying inflammatory arthropathy or chronic degenerative process.
