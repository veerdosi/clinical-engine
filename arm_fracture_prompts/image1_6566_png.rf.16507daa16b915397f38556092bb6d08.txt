The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, specifically showing the humeral head and glenoid fossa. There appears to be a noticeable irregularity at the humeral head, suggesting the presence of osteophytes commonly associated with degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, joint space narrowing is evident, indicative of potential chondral damage and inflammation within the joint structure.
