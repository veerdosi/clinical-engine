The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the shoulder joint and adjacent structures, including the humerus and portions of the cervical spine. Notable is the presence of a bony prominence at the acromion, which may suggest the presence of acromioclavicular joint changes or an associated impingement syndrome. Additionally, there is an observable alteration in joint space that could indicate inflammatory changes or degenerative joint disease affecting the shoulder articulation.
