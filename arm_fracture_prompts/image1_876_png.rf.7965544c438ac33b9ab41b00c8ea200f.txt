The X-ray image reveals a distinct joint space narrowing at the medial compartment of the knee, indicative of osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of subchondral sclerosis, which is a common radiographic finding associated with degenerative joint disease. The presence of osteophytes can be noted at the femoral condyles, further supporting the diagnosis of degenerative changes in the knee joint.
