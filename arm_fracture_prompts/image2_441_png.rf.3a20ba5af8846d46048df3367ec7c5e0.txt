The X-ray image demonstrates a significant fracture of the radial shaft, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is notable angulation and potential displacement of the fractured segments, indicating a possible diaphyseal fracture type. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no evident signs of edema or hematoma in the immediate area.
