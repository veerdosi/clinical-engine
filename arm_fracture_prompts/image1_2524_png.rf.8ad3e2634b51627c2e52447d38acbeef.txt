The X-ray image displays a left wrist with a visible metallic fixation device adjacent to the carpal bones, suggesting prior surgical intervention, likely following a fracture. There is noticeable alignment of the distal radius and ulna, but the presence of the fixation hardware indicates a history of trauma or instability requiring stabilization. Additionally, there may be signs of potential bone healing or remodeling observable in the adjacent soft tissue and surrounding bones.
