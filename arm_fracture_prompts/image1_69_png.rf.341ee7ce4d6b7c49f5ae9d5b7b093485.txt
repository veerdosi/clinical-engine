The X-ray demonstrates a right knee joint with evident signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by narrowing of the joint space and potential subchondral sclerosis. There may also be the presence of osteophytes along the margins of the femur and tibia, suggesting chronic degenerative changes. Additionally, patellar alignment appears altered, indicating possible maltracking that could lead to further joint dysfunction.
