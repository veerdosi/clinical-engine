The X-ray image depicts the right wrist and distal forearm, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a notable displacement at the distal radial metaphysis with a prominent fracture line, indicative of a distal radius fracture, commonly associated with trauma. Additionally, there appears to be soft tissue swelling in the periarticular region, which may suggest underlying edema or hematoma related to the fracture.
