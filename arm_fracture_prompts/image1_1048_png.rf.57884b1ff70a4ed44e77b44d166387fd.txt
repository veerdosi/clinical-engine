The X-ray image demonstrates a right wrist joint with visualization of the distal radius and ulna, alongside the carpal bones. There appears to be an abnormal alignment of the distal radius, which may suggest a potential fracture or deformity in the region. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing across the wrist, indicating possible degenerative changes that could be characteristic of osteoarthritis.
