The X-ray image demonstrates a transverse fracture of the midshaft of the ulna, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone. There is notable displacement at the fracture site, suggesting instability. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed in the adjacent areas, indicating possible associated contusions or hematoma formation.
