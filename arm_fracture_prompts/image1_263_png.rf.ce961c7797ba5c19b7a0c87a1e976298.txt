The X-ray image demonstrates an elbow joint with a possible fracture in the region of the radial head, indicated by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. There appears to be surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may suggest associated hematoma or edema. The alignment of the ulna and humerus is within normal limits, although further evaluation is required to assess any potential ligamentous injury.
