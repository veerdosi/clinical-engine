The X-ray image reveals a significant abnormality at the left elbow joint, characterized by a possible deformity. There is evidence of altered bony architecture, potentially indicative of osteochondritis dissecans or similar pathologies affecting the capitulum and trochlea. Additionally, the radiolucent areas observed around the joint may suggest underlying changes related to joint effusion or early degenerative processes such as osteoarthritis.
