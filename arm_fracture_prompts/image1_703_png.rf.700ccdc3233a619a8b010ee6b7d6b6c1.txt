The image depicts an X-ray of the left forearm, clearly showing the ulna and radius bones. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, which exhibits an angulated displacement. Additionally, the proximal and distal ends of both bones appear intact, suggesting a relatively stable fracture configuration without joint involvement.
