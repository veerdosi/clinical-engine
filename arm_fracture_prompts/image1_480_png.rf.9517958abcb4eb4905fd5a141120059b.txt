The X-ray image displays the right elbow in a lateral view, highlighting the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a jagged line through the cortical bone, suggesting a possible comminuted fracture pattern. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling noted adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate associated hematoma or edema.
