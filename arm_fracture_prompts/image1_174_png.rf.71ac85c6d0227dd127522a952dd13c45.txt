The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the humerus, shoulder, and elbow joint. There is evidence of a proximal humeral fracture, characterized by displacement and angulation of the bone fragments. Additionally, the soft tissue shadows indicate possible edema around the joint, suggesting inflammatory changes consistent with trauma.
