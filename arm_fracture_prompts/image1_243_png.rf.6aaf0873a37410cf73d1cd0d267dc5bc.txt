The X-ray image reveals a significant glenohumeral joint involvement, with evidence of joint effusion and potential subluxation of the humeral head. There is also a notable irregularity in the bony architecture, suggesting possible osteolytic lesions or avascular necrosis. Furthermore, the surrounding soft tissue appears to be edematous, which may indicate inflammatory changes consistent with conditions such as rotator cuff pathology or adhesive capsulitis.
