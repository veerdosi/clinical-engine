The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the humeral head and glenoid cavity. There is a notable presence of osseous irregularities surrounding the proximal humerus, which may indicate the presence of osteophytosis or other degenerative changes. Additionally, the acromion appears to have an altered contour that could suggest subacromial impingement syndrome or related pathologies.
