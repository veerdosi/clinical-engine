The X-ray depicts the lateral view of the forearm, showing the radius and ulna clearly in their anatomical positions. There is evidence of a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue edema. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating a potential deformity, commonly seen in cases of traumatic injury or developmental conditions.
