The X-ray image displays the bones of the left hand, with a focus on the phalanges of the fingers. Notable findings include possible signs of a fracture in one of the distal phalanges, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there may be signs of joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joints, which could indicate underlying osteoarthritis.
