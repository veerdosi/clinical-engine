The X-ray image displays the right knee joint in an anteroposterior (AP) view, clearly illustrating the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable findings include joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the bones indicates possible varus or valgus deformities that could be associated with underlying joint pathology.
