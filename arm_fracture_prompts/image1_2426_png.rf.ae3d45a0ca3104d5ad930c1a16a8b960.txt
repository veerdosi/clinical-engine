The X-ray reveals a left elbow joint with an intramedullary screw positioned within the distal humerus. There is evidence of callus formation surrounding the screw, indicating a previous fracture and subsequent healing process in the area. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears normal without signs of acute edema or fluid accumulation.
