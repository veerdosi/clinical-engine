The X-ray image of the elbow joint demonstrates an abnormal radiolucency in the area surrounding the medial epicondyle, suggestive of a possible osteochondral lesion or bone contusion. There is also notable joint effusion evident by the increased soft tissue density around the olecranon, which may indicate underlying trauma or inflammation. The alignment of the humeroulnar joint appears altered, raising suspicion for ligamentous injury or instability in the elbow region.
