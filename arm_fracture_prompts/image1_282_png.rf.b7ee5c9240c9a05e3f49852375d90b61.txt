The X-ray image displays the right forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna bones. There is a notable diaphyseal fracture observed in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption and angulation. Additionally, there is cortical bone disruption in the ulna, suggesting possible accompanying injury or stress fracture in the context of the overall forearm trauma.
