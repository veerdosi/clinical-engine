The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible fracture in the mid-shaft region of the radius with associated cortical disruption, which suggests a possible acute injury. The alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears intact, indicating that there may not be a significant dislocation of the wrist joint in this view.
