The X-ray image demonstrates the right wrist and distal radius, revealing joint alignment and bony architecture. Notable in the image are signs of potential osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis in the radiocarpal joint. Additionally, there is evidence of possible periosteal reaction along the medial aspect of the distal radius, which may indicate underlying pathology.
