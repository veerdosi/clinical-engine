The X-ray image presented is a lateral view of the left hand, illustrating the skeletal structure of the metacarpals and phalanges. The presence of normal osseous alignment is noted, although any deviations, if present, should be explicitly detailed based on the visual findings. No acute fractures or evidence of bone lesions are observed; however, evaluation for joint space narrowing or signs of osteoarthritic changes may be warranted in the assessment of overall hand health.
