The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the knee joint, showcasing the femur, tibia, and fibula in anatomical alignment. Noteworthy is the presence of osteophyte formation at the joint surfaces, suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint degeneration and potential loss of joint space. Additionally, there appears to be subtle changes in cortical bone density around the knee, which may indicate an underlying pathology such as osteoporosis or a stress reaction.
