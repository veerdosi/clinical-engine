The X-ray image displays the left hand, specifically highlighting the third digit (middle finger). There is a visible metallic object, possibly indicating the presence of an intramedullary fixation device or foreign body, situated near the proximal phalanx. Additionally, the surrounding bone structure appears intact, with no apparent fractures or dislocations visible in the phalanges or metacarpals.

The presence of the metallic object may suggest prior surgical intervention or trauma associated with the digit, but the surrounding soft tissues and joints show no signs of acute inflammation or degenerative changes. All distal phalanges demonstrate normal cortical thickness and alignment, confirming that there are no obvious pathological conditions affecting the other fingers or joints within the examined area.
