The X-ray demonstrates an acute fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus at the elbow joint. There is an evident displacement of the fracture fragments, which may suggest instability in the joint architecture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint may be observed, indicating a possible associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
