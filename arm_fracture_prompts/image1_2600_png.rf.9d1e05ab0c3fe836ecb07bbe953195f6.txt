The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity of the bone. There is also evidence of potential dorsal angulation and displacement, indicating instability at this fracture site. The alignment of the carpal bones appears preserved, although the presence of soft tissue swelling may suggest accompanying hematoma or contusion surrounding the fracture.
