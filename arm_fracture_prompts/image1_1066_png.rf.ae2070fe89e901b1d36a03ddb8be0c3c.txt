The X-ray image displays the left hand with notable changes in the phalangeal structures, indicating possible malalignment. There is an observable fracture line through the proximal phalanx of the middle finger, accompanied by soft tissue edema suggestive of an acute inflammatory response. Additionally, the distal phalanx of the ring finger appears to exhibit signs of a potential fracture or avulsion, further indicating traumatic injury to the digit.
