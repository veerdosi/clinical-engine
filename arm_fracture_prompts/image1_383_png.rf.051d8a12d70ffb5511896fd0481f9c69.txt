The X-ray image reveals a notable valgus deformity at the knee joint, characterized by lateral angulation of the distal femur and proximal tibia. The joint space appears narrowed on the medial side, suggesting potential osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes in the articular cartilage. Additionally, periarticular osteophyte formation is observed, which may indicate chronic joint instability or past trauma affecting the knee integrity.
