The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the left knee joint, illustrating the presence of internal fixation hardware, indicative of prior surgical intervention for a fracture. The metallic implant suggests stabilization of the distal femur or proximal tibia, and notable presence of osteosynthesis materials. Radiographically, there is a lack of acute bony lesions, but the surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of previous trauma or surgical alteration.
