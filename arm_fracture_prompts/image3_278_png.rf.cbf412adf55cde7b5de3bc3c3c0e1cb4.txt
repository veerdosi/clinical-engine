The X-ray image reveals a notable fracture of the diaphysis of the radius, characterized by a well-defined line of interruption through the cortical bone. The surrounding soft tissue appears relatively intact, yet there is a slight displacement evident at the fracture site, indicating a possible unstable fracture pattern. Additionally, no signs of comminution or significant accompanying joint effusion are observed, which may suggest a lower risk of associated complex injuries.
