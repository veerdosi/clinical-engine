The image displays a lateral X-ray view of the left elbow joint, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a notable displacement of the distal humerus, which may indicate a fracture, and there is potential soft tissue swelling observed around the joint. Additionally, the alignment of the olecranon and the relationship between the articulating surfaces suggests possible joint instability or malalignment.
