The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, with the femur, tibia, and fibula visible. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency in the region surrounding the patella, which may suggest underlying pathology such as arthritis or trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears within normal limits, though subtle changes in joint space width may warrant further evaluation for potential degenerative changes.
