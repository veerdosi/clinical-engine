The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral articulation between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There appears to be a notable presence of degenerative changes characterized by osteophyte formation at the humeral head, suggestive of osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be signs of subacromial impingement, indicated by alterations in the acromial morphology and potential narrowing of the subacromial space.
