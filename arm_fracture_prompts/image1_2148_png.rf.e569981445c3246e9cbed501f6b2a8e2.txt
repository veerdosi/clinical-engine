The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint with a surgical fixation device, indicating the presence of an internal fixation system, likely used for the stabilization of fractures. There is evidence of periosteal reaction along the bone, which may suggest prior trauma or surgical intervention that has elicited a healing response. Additionally, the joint space appears slightly reduced, which could be indicative of potential degenerative changes or post-operative alterations in normal anatomy.
