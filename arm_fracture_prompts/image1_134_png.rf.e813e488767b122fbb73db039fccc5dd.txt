The X-ray image demonstrates a left wrist joint with notable radiolucency in the distal radius, suggesting the presence of an acute fracture. There is evidence of misalignment at the fracture site, indicative of potential displacement or angulation. Additionally, adjacent soft tissue swelling is observed, which may imply an associated contusion or hematoma in the vicinity of the injury.
