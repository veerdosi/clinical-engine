The image depicts an X-ray of the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula in a lateral view. Notable findings include a potential joint effusion indicated by increased soft tissue radiolucency surrounding the femorotibial joint, which may suggest underlying pathology such as synovitis or a meniscal tear. Additionally, there appears to be an irregularity in the outline of the articular surfaces, possibly indicative of chondral damage or osteochondral injury, warranting further clinical correlation for diagnosis.
