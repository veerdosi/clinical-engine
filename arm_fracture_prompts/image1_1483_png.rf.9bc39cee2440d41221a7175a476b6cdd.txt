The X-ray image displays anteroposterior and lateral views of the right hand, highlighting the metacarpal bones and phalanges. A notable oblique fracture is observed in the shaft of the fifth metacarpal, characterized by cortical disruption and surrounding soft tissue edema. There is also evidence of potential angulation deformity at the fracture site, necessitating further evaluation for alignment and stability.
