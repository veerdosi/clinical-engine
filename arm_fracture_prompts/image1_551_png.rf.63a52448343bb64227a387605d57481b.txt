The X-ray image displays a left wrist, clearly showing the radiologic anatomy of the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of an abnormal bone formation indicative of a potential osseous deformity in the scaphoid region, which may suggest a possible fracture or non-union. Additionally, the alignment of the carpometacarpal joint appears altered, warranting further investigation for any signs of ligamentous injury or degeneration.
