The X-ray image reveals a notable presence of an intramedullary nail spanning the lower tibia, indicative of a surgical intervention for an unstable fracture. There is also evidence of comminution at the distal end of the fibula, which suggests a complex fracture pattern potentially complicating the healing process. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit swelling, which may indicate associated contusions or hematoma formation at the injury site.
