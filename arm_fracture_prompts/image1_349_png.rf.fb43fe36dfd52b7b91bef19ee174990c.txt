The X-ray image depicts the right forearm in a lateral view, clearly showing the radius, ulna, and the elbow joint. Notable radiolucency is observed at the midshaft of the radius, suggestive of a transverse fracture, which may indicate acute trauma. Surrounding soft tissue swelling may also be present, indicating potential hematoma formation related to the injury.
