The X-ray image shows the right femur, displaying an apparent fracture at the mid-shaft region. The fracture is characterized by a clear disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting a complete or potentially displaced fracture pattern. Additionally, there is evidence of surrounding soft tissue swelling, indicative of associated hematoma formation frequently seen with traumatic injuries.
