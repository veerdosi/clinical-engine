The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture in the distal radius of the right arm, indicated by the significant disruption in cortical continuity. There is evidence of potential misalignment at the fracture site, suggesting a possible angulation or displacement of the fragments. Soft tissue swelling may be present, highlighting a concomitant soft tissue injury associated with the osseous damage.
