The image displays three X-ray views of the wrist and forearm, revealing significant bony structures including the radius, ulna, and carpal bones. The first image shows a normal anatomical alignment, while the second image presents an abnormal angulation of the distal radius suggesting a potential fracture or deformity. The third image demonstrates an area of increased radiolucency in the distal ulna, which may indicate an underlying pathological process, such as osteomyelitis or a bone tumor.
