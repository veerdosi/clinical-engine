The radiographic image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a notable joint effusion indicated by an increased radiolucency surrounding the olecranon, which may suggest the presence of synovitis or bursitis. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears abnormal, raising concerns for possible deformities such as cubitus varus or cubitus valgus.
