The X-ray image depicts the right arm, specifically focusing on the humerus and elbow joint. There is evidence of a significant angular deformity in the distal humerus, suggesting the presence of a fracture. Joint alignment appears compromised, potentially indicating associated soft tissue injury or joint effusion within the elbow region.
