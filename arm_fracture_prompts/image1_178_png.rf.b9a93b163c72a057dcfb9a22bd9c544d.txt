The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left humerus and radius, revealing signs of acute fracture involvement. Notably, there is a distinct disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone along the diaphysis of the radius, indicating a potential fracture line. Additionally, there is significant periosteal reaction observable, suggesting a degree of edema and inflammation in the soft tissues surrounding the affected area.
