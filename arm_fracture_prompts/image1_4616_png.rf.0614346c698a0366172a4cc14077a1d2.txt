The X-ray image displays the bones of the right hand, including the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. There is apparent cortical disruption noted in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, suggestive of a possible fracture or other bone pathology. Additionally, joint spaces appear to be narrowed around the third and fourth metacarpophalangeal joints, which may indicate the presence of degenerative changes or inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis.
