The X-ray image displays an oblique fracture of the humerus, characterized by a break through the mid-shaft region of the bone. There is notable displacement of the fracture fragments, indicating a significant alteration in alignment, which may affect the surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, there is an associated periosteal reaction visible, suggestive of an inflammatory process in response to the injury.
