The X-ray image depicts the left humerus in a lateral view, revealing distinct anatomy of the arm, including the head of the humerus, greater tubercle, and the distal articulation with the ulna and radius. There is evidence of a potential humeral shaft fracture, indicated by irregularity in the cortical margins and radiolucent lines, which may suggest disruption of the bony continuity. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, which often accompanies traumatic injuries to the upper extremity.
