The X-ray images depict the right forearm, showcasing the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a disruption in continuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. The ulna appears intact, but there may be potential associated soft tissue or ligamentous injury indicated by periosteal reaction adjacent to the fracture site.
