The X-ray demonstrates an elongated phalangeal structure with significant radiolucency evident in the distal phalanx, suggesting possible osteolytic bone changes. There is also a notable cortical irregularity along the metacarpal bone, raising concern for potential underlying pathology such as a fracture or bone lesion. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the affected areas appears unremarkable, with no signs of effusion or significant soft tissue swelling.
