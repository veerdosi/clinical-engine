The image depicts an X-ray of the right knee joint, where the femur, tibia, and fibula can be seen in alignment. Notably, there is evidence of osteophyte formation at the joint margins, indicative of osteoarthritis. The presence of narrowing in the joint space further suggests degeneration of the articular cartilage, commonly associated with chronic joint conditions.
