The X-ray image displays a right forearm, specifically showing the radius and ulna in a laterally oriented view. There is an evident fracture of the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone, with possible alignment disturbance and callous formation indicating a healing response. The ulna appears intact without visible deformities or fractures, suggesting that the injury is isolated to the radius.
