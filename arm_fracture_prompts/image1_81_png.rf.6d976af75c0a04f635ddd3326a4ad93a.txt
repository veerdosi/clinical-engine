The X-ray image presents the lateral view of the right hand, particularly focusing on the phalanges of the thumb. There is evidence of osteophyte formation at the interphalangeal joint, indicative of possible degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be a bony prominence or alignment issue at the metacarpophalangeal joint, suggesting a possible deformity such as a boutonniere or mallet finger.
