The image demonstrates an X-ray of the right knee joint, with a notable presence of an effusion indicating synovial fluid accumulation within the joint space. There appears to be irregularity in the articular surfaces, suggesting possible osteoarthritis or chondral injury, particularly in the femoral condyles. Additionally, there is evidence of subchondral sclerosis, which is consistent with degenerative changes often associated with chronic joint stress or trauma.
