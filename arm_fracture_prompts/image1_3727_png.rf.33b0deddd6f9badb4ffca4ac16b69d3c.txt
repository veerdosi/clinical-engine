The X-ray image presented depicts a left elbow joint, where the ulna and radius are visible. Notably, there is an intramedullary fixation device traversing the distal humerus, indicating surgical intervention, likely due to a previous fracture or instability in the region. There is evidence of periosteal reaction surrounding the fixation hardware, suggestive of underlying bone remodeling or localized trauma.
