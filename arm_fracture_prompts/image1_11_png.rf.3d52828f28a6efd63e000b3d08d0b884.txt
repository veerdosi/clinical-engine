The X-ray image displays the right knee joint, focusing on the femoral condyles and proximal tibia. There is evidence of osteoarthritis, indicated by narrowed joint spaces and potential subchondral sclerosis surrounding the femoral and tibial articulations. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes along the edges of the joint surfaces suggests degenerative changes commonly associated with chronic wear and tear.
