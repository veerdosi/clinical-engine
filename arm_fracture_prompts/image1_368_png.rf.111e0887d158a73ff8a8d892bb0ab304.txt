The X-ray images depict multiple views of the wrist and forearm, including the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible malalignment or angular deformity present in the distal radius, which may suggest a fracture or post-fracture remodeling. Additionally, the joint spaces appear to be narrowed, indicating potential degenerative changes or inflammatory processes affecting the wrist joint.
