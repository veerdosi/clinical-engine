The x-ray image presented shows the right hand in a lateral view, highlighting the phalangeal bones and the metacarpals. There appears to be evidence of joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation at the distal interphalangeal joints, suggestive of degenerative joint disease, commonly known as osteoarthritis. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joints may indicate an inflammatory process, which could be associated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
