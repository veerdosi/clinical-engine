The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right elbow joint, characterized by a visible fracture of the radial head. There is also an observable joint effusion indicated by the prominence of the anterior fat pad sign, suggesting possible intra-articular pathology. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna indicates an abnormal angulation, which could suggest the presence of a deformity or malalignment in the forearm.
