The X-ray image displays the left wrist, showing the carpal and metacarpal bones in anatomic alignment. There is an evident fracture at the distal end of the radius, characterized by a disrupted cortical margin and surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, early degenerative changes are visible at the radiocarpal joint, suggesting potential osteoarthritis.
