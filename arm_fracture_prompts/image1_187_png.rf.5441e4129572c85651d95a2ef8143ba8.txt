The image depicts a lateral radiographic view of the right humerus and elbow joint. There is evidence of a possible fracture or irregularity in the contour of the humeral shaft, which may indicate a pathological condition such as a fracture or a deformity. Additionally, there is joint effusion noted at the elbow joint, as evidenced by the increased radiolucency around the joint space, suggesting an inflammatory process or trauma.
