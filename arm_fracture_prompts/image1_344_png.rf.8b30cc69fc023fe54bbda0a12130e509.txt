The X-ray image reveals the right shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint with a well-defined glenoid fossa and humeral head. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, subacromial impingement may be suggested by the spatial relationship of the humeral head to the acromion, potentially leading to rotator cuff pathology.
