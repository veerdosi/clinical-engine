The X-ray image of the right wrist reveals a normal alignment of the carpal bones, including the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum, with no evidence of acute fractures. The radiolucency of the carpals appears normal, indicating no signs of osteolysis or significant degenerative changes. However, there is notable soft tissue swelling around the wrist joints, which may suggest underlying inflammatory processes such as tenosynovitis or synovitis.
