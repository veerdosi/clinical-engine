The X-ray image shows a clear view of the forearm, including both the radius and ulna. Notably, there appears to be a diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a transverse fracture line with possible displacement. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area, which may indicate hematoma formation.
