The X-ray image reveals the left forearm, prominently displaying a metallic plate and screws fixed to the distal radius, indicative of surgical intervention likely following a fracture. There is a notable alignment of the bony structures, although the presence of hardware suggests prior trauma, which may include a fracture or osteosynthesis procedure. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable on this radiograph, with no evident signs of acute bony pathology such as displacement or malunion.
