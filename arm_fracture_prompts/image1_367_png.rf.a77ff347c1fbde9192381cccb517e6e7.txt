The X-ray images presented depict the right lower extremity, including the distal femur, knee joint, proximal tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the tibia and fibula, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortices and the presence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the involved area. Additionally, the alignment of the long bones appears to be compromised, which may suggest deformity or malalignment in the context of a traumatic injury.
