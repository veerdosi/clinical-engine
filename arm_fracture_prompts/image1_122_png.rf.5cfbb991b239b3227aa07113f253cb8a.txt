The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, including the distal radius and ulna, with notable alignment and contour. There is a visible metaphyseal fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a break in the continuity of the bone cortex. Additionally, there are signs of potential soft tissue swelling present around the fracture site, which can indicate associated contusion or hematoma formation.
