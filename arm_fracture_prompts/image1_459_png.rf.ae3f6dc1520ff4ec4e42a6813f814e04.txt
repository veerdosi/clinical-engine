The image displays an anteroposterior radiograph of the forearm, with clear visible structures of the radius and ulna. Notably, there appears to be an oblique fracture of the distal radius with displacement, characterized by a loss of alignment at the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the area, which may indicate hematoma formation associated with the fracture.
