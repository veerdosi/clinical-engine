The X-ray image depicts a long bone of the forelimb, showing a mid-shaft fracture characterized by cortical disruption and callus formation. There is evident periosteal reaction suggesting a healing process indicative of a recent traumatic event, which may be classified as a closed fracture. Additionally, there are signs of potential malalignment, as the fracture line exhibits lateral angulation, which could impact functional recovery and necessitate further evaluation.
