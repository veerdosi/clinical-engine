The X-ray image presents the right shoulder and upper thoracic spine, revealing a potential acromioclavicular joint widening, which may suggest osteoarthritis or an acromioclavicular joint injury. The visibility of the scapula and proximal humerus is intact, with no apparent fractures noted in the bony structures. Additionally, the cervical spine alignment appears within normal limits, although further examination may be warranted to assess for any underlying degenerative changes.
