The image presents an X-ray of the left forearm, demonstrating the distal radius and ulna in an anatomical view. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and potential displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the fracture site, suggesting the possibility of associated soft tissue injury or hematoma formation.
