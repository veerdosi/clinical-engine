The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the humerus, with notable findings suggesting potential pathological changes. There is evidence of increased radiolucency surrounding the area of interest, which may indicate osteolytic lesions possibly associated with conditions such as osteomyelitis or metastatic disease. Additionally, any irregularities in the bone contour may suggest underlying deformities, such as a possible pathological fracture or signs of bone weakening.
