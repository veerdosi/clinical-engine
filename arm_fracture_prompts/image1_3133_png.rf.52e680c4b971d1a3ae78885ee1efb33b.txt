The X-ray image depicts the left hand, focusing on the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there are signs of possible osteoarthritic changes characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis in the metacarpophalangeal joints. The presence of any bony spurs or deformities in the phalanges may indicate the development of degenerative joint disease.
