The image presents an anteroposterior (AP) view of the left forearm, showcasing distinct abnormalities in the radial and ulnar bones. There is evidence of a dislocation at the distal radioulnar joint, characterized by a misalignment of the radius and ulna. Additionally, the cortical integrity is compromised, with signs of possible osteopenia or a fracture noted along the shaft of the radius.
