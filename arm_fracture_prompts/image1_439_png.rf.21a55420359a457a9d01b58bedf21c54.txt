The X-ray image displays the left lower limb, specifically focusing on the tibia and fibula. Notable is the presence of a diaphyseal fracture in the tibia, characterized by a clear break in the cortical bone, which may indicate a potential disruption of the periosteum. Additionally, there are signs of callus formation at the fracture site, suggestive of ongoing healing processes and increased bone remodeling activity.
