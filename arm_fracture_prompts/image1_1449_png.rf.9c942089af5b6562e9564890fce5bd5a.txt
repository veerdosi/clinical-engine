The provided X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the left wrist, illustrating post-surgical fixation in the distal radius and ulnar region. Notably, there appears to be a plate and screws in situ, indicating previous surgical intervention likely related to a fracture of the distal radius. The surrounding bony structures show normal alignment, with no evident signs of malunion or nonunion at the fracture site.
