The X-ray image depicts a right wrist with a visible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by misalignment and localized osseous disruption. There is an intra-articular component suggestive of a potential avulsion or fracture fragment involving the radiocarpal joint. Additionally, the presence of metallic fixation, likely indicative of surgical intervention or stabilization, is noted within the fracture site.
