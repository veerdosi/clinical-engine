The X-ray image in question displays the right knee joint, where both the femur and tibia can be visualized, along with the patella. There is evidence suggestive of a joint effusion, as indicated by a radiolucent area around the knee joint, potentially indicating inflammation or intra-articular pathology. Additionally, there appears to be a presence of osteophytes along the joint margins, which is commonly associated with degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis.
