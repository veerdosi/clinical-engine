The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the forearm, showing the radius and ulna. There is a notable mid-shaft anterior bowing of the radius, indicative of a possible deformity, which could be associated with conditions like osteogenesis imperfecta or a previous fracture malunion. Additionally, there is a slight radiolucency observed along the diaphysis, suggesting the potential presence of an underlying pathology such as osteomyelitis or a benign bone lesion.
