The radiographic image demonstrates a significant alignment discrepancy in the long bone, specifically indicative of a malunited fracture. Notably, there is the presence of internal fixation hardware, including screws and a plate, suggesting prior surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of potential callus formation at the fracture site, which may complicate the healing process and warrant further evaluation for any underlying osteogenic issues.
