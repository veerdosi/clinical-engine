The X-ray image depicts the left hand, specifically highlighting the proximal phalanx of the index finger. There is evidence of a potential fracture or deformity at the base of the proximal phalanx, indicated by irregularities in the cortical bone and possible misalignment. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the area, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or hematoma formation.
