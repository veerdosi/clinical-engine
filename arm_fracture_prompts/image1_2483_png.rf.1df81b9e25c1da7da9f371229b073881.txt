The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the wrist joint, revealing notable cortical disruption around the distal radius and ulna. There is significant soft tissue swelling, suggestive of a possible acute traumatic event, along with a potential fracture line involving the distal radius. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears to be altered, raising suspicion for a possible scaphoid fracture or associated wrist instability.
