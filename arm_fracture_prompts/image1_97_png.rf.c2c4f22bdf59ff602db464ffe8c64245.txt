The X-ray image depicts a right elbow joint in a flexed position, showcasing potential abnormalities. There is evidence of a distal humeral fracture, indicated by a discontinuity in the cortical bone along the humerus. Additionally, alterations in the alignment of the ulna and radius suggest a possible ulnar or radial/subluxation involvement that may affect the elbow's stability and function.
