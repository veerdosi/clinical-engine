The X-ray image displays the bony structures of the left hand and wrist, showing the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. There is a notable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone, indicating a possible injury to the wrist joint area. Additionally, signs of osteoarthritis can be observed in the metacarpophalangeal joints, including joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis.
