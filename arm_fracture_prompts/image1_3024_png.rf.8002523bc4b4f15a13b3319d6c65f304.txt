The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder, with notable surgical instrumentation visible in the humeral region. There is evidence of a proximal humeral fracture, which has been stabilized through the use of an orthopedic plate and screws. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema, indicating a potential inflammatory response associated with the previous injury or surgical intervention.
