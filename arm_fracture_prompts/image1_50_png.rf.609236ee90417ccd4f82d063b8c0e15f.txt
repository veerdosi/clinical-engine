The X-ray image depicts a right wrist and distal forearm, showing the carpal and distal radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in cortical continuity and changes in the surrounding soft tissue density. Additionally, signs of radiocarpal joint involvement may indicate potential ligamentous injury or instability associated with the fracture.
