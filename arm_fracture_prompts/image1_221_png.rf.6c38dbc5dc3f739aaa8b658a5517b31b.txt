The X-ray image presents a right shoulder view, revealing a prominent acromioclavicular (AC) joint with potential hypertrophy. There is observable joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis affecting the AC joint. Additionally, light cortical thinning is noted along the greater tuberosity of the humerus, indicating possible changes related to impingement syndrome.
