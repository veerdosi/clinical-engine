The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the lower leg, specifically demonstrating the tibia and fibula. There is an evident fracture in the distal shaft of the tibia, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue edema, indicating a potential acute injury. Additionally, the fibula appears intact, without evidence of concurrent fracture or displacement, suggesting a possible isolated fracture of the tibia.
