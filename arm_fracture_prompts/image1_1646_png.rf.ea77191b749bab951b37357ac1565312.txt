The provided X-ray image displays the right femur and the knee joint, demonstrating a well-defined radiopaque screw indicating prior surgical intervention for internal fixation. There is a notable alignment deviation, suggesting possible malunion or improper healing of the fracture segments in the distal femur region. Additionally, joint space narrowing could signify the onset of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease affecting the knee articulation, warranting further evaluation.
