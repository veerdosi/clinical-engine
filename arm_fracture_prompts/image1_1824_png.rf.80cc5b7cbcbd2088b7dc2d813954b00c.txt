The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal structures. There is noted angulation at the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, which suggests the presence of a deformity potentially indicating a fracture or dislocation. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, although the alignment of the osseous structures should be evaluated for any signs of healing or malunion.
