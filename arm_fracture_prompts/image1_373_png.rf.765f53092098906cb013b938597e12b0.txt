The X-ray image demonstrates the left forearm, specifically visualizing the ulna and radius in an anteroposterior view. There is evidence of a diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a prominent disruption in the cortical bone and associated soft tissue swelling. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating potential instability at the fracture site, and there may be accompanying osseous edema evident in the periosteal regions.
