The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna in the forearm, with an overlying splint indicated by the labeling of "POST SPLINT." There are notable signs of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone and possible displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the fracture site, suggesting associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
