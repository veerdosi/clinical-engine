The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder, revealing a metallic plate and several screws affixed to the proximal humerus, indicative of internal fixation following a surgical intervention. There is a notable presence of irregular bone morphology around the implantation site, potentially suggestive of previous fracture or osteosynthesis procedures. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted adjacent to the surgical site, which could indicate an inflammatory response or postoperative changes.
