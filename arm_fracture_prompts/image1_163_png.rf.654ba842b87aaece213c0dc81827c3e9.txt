The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the right elbow joint, highlighting the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is evidence of an olecranon bursa effusion, characterized by an increased soft tissue shadow localized posterior to the olecranon process, indicative of potential inflammatory changes. Additionally, mild joint space narrowing can be observed, suggesting the possibility of degenerative changes, commonly associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis.
