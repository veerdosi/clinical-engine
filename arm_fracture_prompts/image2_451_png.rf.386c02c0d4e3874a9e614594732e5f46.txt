The X-ray depicts the left shoulder in an anteroposterior view, revealing the contour of the humeral head and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is a notable presence of osteophytes along the glenohumeral joint margins, suggestive of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the acromion and clavicle appear normal, with no evident fractures or dislocations observed in the surrounding structures.
