The X-ray image displays bilateral wrist joints, showcasing both the distal radius and ulna as well as the carpal bones. There is evidence of potential degenerative changes, such as joint space narrowing and possible osteophyte formation, which may indicate osteoarthritis. Additionally, asymmetric bony alignment or positioning of the carpal bones can suggest the presence of an underlying deformity affecting wrist mechanics.
