The image depicts a lateral view of the left knee joint, highlighting the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and the patella. There is a notable presence of joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, suggesting potential intra-articular pathology. Additionally, there may be evidence of osteophyte formation around the joint margins, which could indicate a degenerative joint condition such as osteoarthritis.
