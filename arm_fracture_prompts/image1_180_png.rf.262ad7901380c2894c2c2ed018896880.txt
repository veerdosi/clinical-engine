The X-ray image depicts the right wrist and hand, revealing potential signs of a fracture involving the distal radius and possible displacement of the distal ulnar joint. Notably, gaps in the cortical bone integrity suggest a possible fracture, and increased radiolucency around the fracture site may imply acute edema or hematoma formation. Additionally, joint spaces appear well-defined, with no significant signs of osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes observed in this view.
