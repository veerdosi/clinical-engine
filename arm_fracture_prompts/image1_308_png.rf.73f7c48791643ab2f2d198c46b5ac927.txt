The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, revealing a potential acromioclavicular joint degeneration characterized by subchondral sclerosis and irregular joint space narrowing. There is also evidence of osteophyte formation at the acromion, suggestive of early-stage osteoarthritis in the shoulder region. Additionally, the humeral head appears to exhibit a normal contour, indicating the absence of acute fractures or dislocations within the evaluated area.
