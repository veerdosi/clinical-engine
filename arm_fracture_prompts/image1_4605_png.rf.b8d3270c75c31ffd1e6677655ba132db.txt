The X-ray image demonstrates an irregular contour of the phalanx, indicating possible subluxation or dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint. There is a notable radiolucency in the proximal portion of the bone, suggestive of a potential cystic lesion or osteolytic process. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the joint appears edematous, which may indicate the presence of inflammation or trauma.
