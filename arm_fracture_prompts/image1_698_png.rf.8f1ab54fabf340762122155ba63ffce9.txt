The X-ray image presented shows the right elbow joint in a flexed position, allowing assessment of the radial head and the capitellum. Notably, there is a concern regarding joint alignment, with a potential misalignment of the radial head relative to the capitellum indicative of possible angular deformity. The surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of effusion, which is often associated with inflammatory processes or trauma affecting the elbow joint.
