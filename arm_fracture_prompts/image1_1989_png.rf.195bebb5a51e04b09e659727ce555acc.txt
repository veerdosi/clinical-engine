The X-ray image displays the left wrist and forearm, revealing distinct anatomical landmarks such as the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a displacement and a potential comminuted pattern. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, indicative of trauma or inflammatory response related to the bony injury.
