The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, with notable changes in the ulnar bone structure. There is evidence of a fracture, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity with associated angulation. Additionally, the presence of periosteal reaction may indicate an acute or chronic injury to the bone, suggesting an underlying pathologic process that warrants further evaluation.
