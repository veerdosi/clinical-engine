The X-ray image depicts the humerus, radius, and ulna in a lateral view of the elbow joint. There appears to be an abnormal alignment of the humerus, indicating a potential angulation deformity, which may suggest an underlying condition such as a fracture or a dislocation. Additionally, the joint space at the elbow exhibits irregularities, which could indicate effusion or other degenerative changes related to inflammatory or post-traumatic arthritis.
