The image presents a lateral view of the left thumb, specifically focusing on the interphalangeal joint. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, suggestive of potential osteoarthritis, characterized by visible subchondral sclerosis and bone spurs at the articular surfaces. Additionally, there is a possible fragmentation of the distal phalanx, which may indicate a previous fracture or avulsion injury.
