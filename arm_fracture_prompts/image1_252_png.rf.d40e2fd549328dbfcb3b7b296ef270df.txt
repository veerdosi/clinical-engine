The X-ray image displays the bones of the right hand, specifically the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, the image reveals a fracture in the proximal phalanx of the second digit, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and potential displacement. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating an associated soft tissue injury.
