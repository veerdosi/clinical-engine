The X-ray image depicts the wrist and distal forearm, showing a potential fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortical bone. Notably, there is an alteration in the alignment of the ulnar and radial bones, suggesting a possible displacement resulting from the fracture. The articular surfaces appear intact, with no observable signs of malunion or nonunion in the surrounding bony structures.
