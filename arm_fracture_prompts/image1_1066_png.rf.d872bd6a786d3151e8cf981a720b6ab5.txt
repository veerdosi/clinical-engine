The image depicts a series of X-rays of the left hand, showing multiple views for evaluation. Notably, there is evidence of misalignment in the proximal interphalangeal joints of some fingers, which may suggest the presence of a malunion or dislocation. Additionally, the phalangeal bones exhibit signs of osteopenia, which could indicate underlying metabolic bone disease or chronic disuse.
