The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left forearm, revealing the presence of an internal fixation device, likely indicating prior surgical intervention for a fracture. The metal hardware appears well-positioned, with several screws and plates securing the fractured segments of the radius and/or ulna. There is an absence of notable callus formation or complications such as malunion or nonunion, suggesting an ongoing healing process post-surgery.
