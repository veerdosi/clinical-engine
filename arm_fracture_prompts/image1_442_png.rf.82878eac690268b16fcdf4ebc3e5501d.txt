The X-ray image displays the forearm, specifically illustrating both the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is a significant oblique fracture of the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a displacement, highlighting a potential compromise to the stability of the bone structure. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be observed, indicating a response to the fracture, which suggests the involvement of surrounding soft tissues and the potential for associated edema.
