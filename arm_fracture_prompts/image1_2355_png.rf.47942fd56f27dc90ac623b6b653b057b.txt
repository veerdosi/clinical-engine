The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left hand, demonstrating the skeletal structure including the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of bone density changes in the proximal phalanges, suggesting possible osteopenia, which may predispose the patient to fractures. Additionally, the visual alignment of the second and third metacarpals appears slightly altered, potentially indicating a developing malalignment or previous injury necessitating further evaluation.
