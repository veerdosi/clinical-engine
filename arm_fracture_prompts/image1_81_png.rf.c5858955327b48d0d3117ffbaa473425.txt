The X-ray image of the right hand shows marked osteophyte formation along the first metacarpophalangeal joint, indicating the presence of osteoarthritis. The joint space appears narrowed, suggesting cartilage degradation, which is characteristic of degenerative joint disease. Additionally, there is subluxation of the proximal phalanx relative to the metacarpal, further illustrating the functional impairment associated with the joint pathology.
