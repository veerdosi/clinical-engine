The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left elbow joint, showcasing a metallic fixation device in situ, indicative of an osteosynthesis procedure. There are clear signs of probable post-operative changes surrounding the distal humerus and proximal radius, suggesting a previous fracture that necessitated surgical intervention. Additionally, the presence of the hardware may indicate potential complications such as peri-implant osteolysis or nonunion, which can require further evaluation and management.
