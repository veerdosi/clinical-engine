The X-ray image reveals a notable fracture of the humerus, characterized by a transverse line across the diaphysis. Surrounding the fracture site, there is evidence of soft tissue edema, indicating potential hematoma formation. Additionally, joint alignment appears intact, but the presence of metallic fixation devices suggests previous surgical intervention for stabilization.
