The X-ray image of the right wrist demonstrates an alignment of the carpal bones, with clear visualization of the scaphoid and lunate bones. There are no evident signs of fracture or dislocation, but slight abnormalities in joint space narrowing may suggest early signs of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the radiolucent areas observed in the proximal carpal region could indicate potential cystic changes or an underlying bone pathology, necessitating further investigation.
