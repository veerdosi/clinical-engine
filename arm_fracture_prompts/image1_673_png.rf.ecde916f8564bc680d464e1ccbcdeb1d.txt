The provided image showcases an X-ray of the right hand, highlighting the phalangeal bones and their alignment. Notably, there appears to be some joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation at the metacarpophalangeal joints, indicative of potential osteoarthritis. Additionally, a possible malalignment of the proximal interphalangeal joint can be observed, which may suggest the presence of a bunion or other degenerative joint conditions.
