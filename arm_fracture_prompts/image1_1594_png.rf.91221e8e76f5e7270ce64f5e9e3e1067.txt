The X-ray provides a lateral view of the right forearm, demonstrating the radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft radial fracture, characterized by a clear disruption in bone continuity and callus formation indicative of a healing process. Additionally, there is possible alteration in the alignment of adjacent structures, suggesting a degree of angulation at the fracture site.
