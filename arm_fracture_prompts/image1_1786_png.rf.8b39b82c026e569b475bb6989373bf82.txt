The X-ray of the right wrist shows a clear view of the distal radius and ulna, revealing the typical anatomical alignment of the forearm bones. There is a noticeable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a cortical disruption and loss of continuity, which may indicate an acute injury. Additionally, there is evidence of a possible associated soft tissue swelling around the site of the fracture, raising concerns for potential ligamentous injury or hematoma formation.
