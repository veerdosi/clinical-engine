The X-ray image displays the right forearm in a supinated position, illustrating the radius and ulna in alignment. Notably, there is a distinct angulation at the mid-shaft of the radius, suggestive of a possible fracture or deformity in this segment. The soft tissue contours appear normal with no evident signs of swelling or foreign bodies adjacent to the bony structures.
