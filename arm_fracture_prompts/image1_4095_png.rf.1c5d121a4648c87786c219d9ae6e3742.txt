The X-ray image presents a left shoulder joint with evidence of a shoulder arthroplasty, indicated by the presence of a prosthetic humeral head and stem, which is aligned within the glenoid fossa. Notably, the prosthesis is well-positioned, exhibiting no signs of radiolucency around the implant that might suggest loosening or osteolysis. The surrounding osseous structures appear intact with no acute fracture or dislocation discernible in this view, indicating stable joint alignment post-surgery.
