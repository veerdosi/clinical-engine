The X-ray image depicts the right hand, focusing primarily on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is notable shortening and angulation of the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may indicate a malunion or a developmental deformity of the bone. Additionally, there are signs of possible overlying soft tissue swelling that could suggest an associated inflammatory condition or recent trauma.
