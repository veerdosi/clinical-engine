The radiographic image demonstrates the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges of the wrist and hand. There is evidence of a potential fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and possible soft tissue swelling. Additionally, alignment of the wrist joint appears compromised, suggesting a possible dislocation or associated ligamentous injury.
