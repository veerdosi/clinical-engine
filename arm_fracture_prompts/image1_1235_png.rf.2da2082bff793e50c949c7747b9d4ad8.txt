The X-ray image depicts the forearm and wrist, revealing the anatomical alignment of the radius and ulna, which appear to be intact. Notably, there is a deformity characterized by abnormal angulation and possible malalignment of the distal segment of the radius, suggestive of a fracture or malunion. Additionally, there may be an abnormality in the articulation of the carpal bones, indicating potential joint incongruence or intra-articular pathology.
