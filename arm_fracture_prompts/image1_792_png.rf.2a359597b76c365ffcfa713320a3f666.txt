The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the shoulder girdle, including the scapula, clavicle, and proximal humerus. Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture in the proximal humerus, characterized by an irregular contour and separation of bony fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the shoulder joint may indicate an associated hematoma or edema, which is often seen in acute traumatic events.
