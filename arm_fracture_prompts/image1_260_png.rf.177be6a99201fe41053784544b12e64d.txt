The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, displaying the radius and ulna in a lateral projection. There is a noticeable mid-shaft diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone and significant angulation. Additionally, the ulna appears intact, although careful assessment of both bones is essential for potential associated injuries or complications such as radial nerve palsy.
