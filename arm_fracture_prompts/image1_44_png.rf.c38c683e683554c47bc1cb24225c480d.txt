The X-ray image shows a complete fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and associated with significant displacement. There is also an appearance of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, indicating possible inflammation. The alignment of the distal ulna appears intact, with no signs of an associated fracture or significant deformity in the forearm bones.
