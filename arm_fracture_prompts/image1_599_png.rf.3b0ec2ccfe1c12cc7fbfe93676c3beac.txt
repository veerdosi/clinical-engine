The X-ray image primarily depicts the phalanges of the second digit (index finger) of the right hand. There is a visible fracture in the proximal phalanx, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting a possible compression or tensile force. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate associated contusions or hematoma formation.
