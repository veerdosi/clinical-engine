The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal curvature of the humerus, indicative of possible deformity or underlying pathology. There is also evidence of a fracture within the midshaft region of the left humerus, showing misalignment and potential callus formation. Additional soft tissue opacity surrounding the affected area suggests possible hematoma or edema consistent with traumatic injury.
