The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the left arm, illustrating the proximal and distal aspects of the radius and ulna bones. There is an observable cortical disruption along the diaphysis of one of the forearm bones, indicative of a possible fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal and metacarpal bones appears normal, with no evidence of dislocation or significant degenerative changes.
