The X-ray image displays a radiographic view of the right hand and wrist, highlighting the carpal bones and metacarpals. Notable is the presence of a visible fracture line in the distal radius, which may indicate a fracture pattern consistent with a distal radius fracture or Colles' fracture. Additionally, there are signs of potential joint incongruity, particularly at the wrist joint, raising concerns for possible ligamentous injury or instability.
