The X-ray images depict the left forearm in an anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view, showing the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible fracture line present in the midshaft region of the radius, characterized by a displaced fracture pattern, which is indicative of potential instability. The alignment of the ulna appears intact with no signs of acute trauma or degenerative changes, and the articulations at the wrist and elbow joint maintain normal architecture without effusion or osseous abnormalities.
