Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the patella, suggestive of potential inflammatory processes or trauma. Additionally, there is indications of possible osteophyte formation at the joint margins, which may indicate degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis.
