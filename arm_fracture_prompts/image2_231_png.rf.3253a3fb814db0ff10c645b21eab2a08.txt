The X-ray image demonstrates the presence of internal fixation devices, including plates and screws, utilized for the stabilization of fractured bone segments in the right forearm. There is evident angular deformity of the distal radius, indicating malalignment, which may be a post-traumatic consequence or due to improper healing of the fracture. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema or callus formation, suggesting a healing response to the prior fracture event.
