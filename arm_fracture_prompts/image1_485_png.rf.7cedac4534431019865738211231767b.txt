The X-ray image displays the right forearm, particularly highlighting the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a fracture in the radial shaft with surgical fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, indicating prior surgical intervention for stabilization. The surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, which could be a response to the injury or the surgical procedure.
