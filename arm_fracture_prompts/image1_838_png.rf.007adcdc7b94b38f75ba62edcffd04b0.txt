The provided image depicts a lateral X-ray view of the left forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna bones. There is notable radiolucency in the distal radial metaphysis, indicative of potential pathological changes such as osteomyelitis or a benign process like bone cyst formation. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears normal, with no evident fractures or angular deformities observed in this radiographic projection.
