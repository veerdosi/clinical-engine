The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand, revealing the bony architecture of the metacarpals and phalanges. There is notable alignment of the bones, but potential joint effusion may be present in the MCP joints, indicated by soft tissue swelling around the areas. No acute fractures or osseous lesions are observed; however, further examination may be warranted to assess for any signs of osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes.
