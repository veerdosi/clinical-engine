The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, revealing a significant angular deformity in the midshaft of the radius, which suggests the presence of a fracture. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, indicative of an associated hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius appears compromised, potentially affecting the functional integrity of the wrist joint.
