The X-ray image reveals a clear view of the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna, highlighting the normal anatomical alignment of the wrist. However, there is evidence of a potential fracture or displacement, particularly in the distal radius, which may indicate a fracture pattern associated with wrist trauma. Additionally, the joint spaces appear well-defined, but any deviation in bone density or irregularity could suggest underlying pathologies such as osteopenia or early signs of arthritis.
