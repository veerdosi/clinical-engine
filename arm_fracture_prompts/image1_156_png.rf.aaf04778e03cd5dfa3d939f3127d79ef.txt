The image depicts an X-ray of the left hand, showing multiple metacarpal bones and phalanges. There is evidence of potential osteoarthritic changes, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis at the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there appears to be an abnormal curvature of the proximal phalanx of the little finger, which may indicate a potential deformity, such as a boutonni√®re or mallet finger.
