The radiograph displays the left knee joint with well-defined architecture of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, as indicated by the lucency in the supra-patellar bursa region, suggesting the presence of synovial fluid accumulation. Additionally, there is potential marginal osteophyte formation along the joint margins, which may indicate early signs of osteoarthritis.
