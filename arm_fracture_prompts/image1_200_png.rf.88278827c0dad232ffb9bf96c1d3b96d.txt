The X-ray image displays the left humerus, highlighting the proximal and distal aspects of the bone. There is evidence of an abnormal bony contour with potential signs of malalignment, possibly indicative of a fracture or deformity at the mid-shaft of the humerus. The joint spaces appear normal, but there is an unusual increase in radiolucency at the fracture site, which may suggest underlying pathology such as a bone lesion or stress fracture.
