The X-ray image depicts a right wrist in a posteroanterior view, demonstrating evidence of a distal radius fracture, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity at the distal end of the radius. There is also notable angulation observed, suggesting a potential dorsal angulation of the fracture fragment, which is consistent with a common type of fracture seen in wrist injuries. Additionally, the presence of an intra-articular involvement may indicate a risk for subsequent joint complications, affecting the carpal alignment and overall wrist function.
