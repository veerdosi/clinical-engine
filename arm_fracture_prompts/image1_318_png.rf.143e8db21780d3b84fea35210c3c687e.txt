The X-ray image demonstrates a pronounced anterior angulation and possible fracture of the mid-shaft of the ulna, along with a significant displacement. The involvement of the adjacent soft tissues suggests a fracture-dislocation pattern at the elbow joint, which may lead to further complications, such as neurovascular injury. The cortical disruption and malalignment seen in the radial head may indicate associated injuries, such as an interosseous membrane tear or compartment syndrome concerns within the forearm.
