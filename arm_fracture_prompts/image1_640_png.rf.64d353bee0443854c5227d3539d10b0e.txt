The x-ray image displays the left hand, with an emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a potential deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joints, which could indicate the presence of conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, suggesting possible displacement or joint degeneration that warrants further evaluation.
