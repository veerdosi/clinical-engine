The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the presence of internal fixation hardware, which indicates previous osteosynthesis. There is evidence of an olecranon fracture, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone cortex and associated soft tissue swelling. The alignment of the joint surfaces appears to be intact, but there is a notable lack of callus formation surrounding the fracture site, suggesting a potential delay in healing.
