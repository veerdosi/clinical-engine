The image displays an X-ray of the left hand, focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable is the presence of a possible fracture in the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a displacement suggesting instability. The surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, indicative of an inflammatory response to the injury.
