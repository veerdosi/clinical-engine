The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the elbow joint, where the humerus, radius, and ulna are visible. There is evidence of a notable joint effusion, characterized by increased radiolucency around the joint space, which may indicate inflammation or potential hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the trochlea and capitulum appears altered, suggesting possible angular deformity or malalignment of the articulating surfaces, warranting further clinical correlation.
