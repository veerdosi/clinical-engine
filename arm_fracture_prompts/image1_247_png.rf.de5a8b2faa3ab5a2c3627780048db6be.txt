The X-ray image depicts the right wrist, demonstrating the anatomical structures of the distal radius and ulna, as well as the carpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a sharp displacement and a discernible fracture line. Additionally, mild cortical irregularity and edema may be observed around the fracture site, suggesting recent trauma to the region.
