The X-ray image presented demonstrates the left shoulder joint, revealing the proximal humerus and a portion of the scapula. There is evidence of a potential fracture or dislocation at the surgical neck of the humerus, indicated by irregular cortical outlines and altered alignment. Associated soft tissue swelling may be present, necessitating further evaluation for any additional injuries or complications.
