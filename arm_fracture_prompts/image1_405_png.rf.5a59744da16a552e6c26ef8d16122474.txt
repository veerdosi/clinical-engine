The X-ray image displays three views of the wrist and hand, highlighting multiple bones surrounding the carpal region and proximal phalanges. Notably, there is a noticeable lucency in the scaphoid bone, which could indicate a possible fracture or bone edema. Additionally, there appears to be misalignment of the distal radius, suggesting a potential distal radius fracture or malunion that may affect wrist stability and function.
