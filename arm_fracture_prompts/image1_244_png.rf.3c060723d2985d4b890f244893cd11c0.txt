The X-ray image depicts the left hand in a specific finger position, displaying the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a visible angulation or misalignment in one of the proximal phalanges, suggestive of a possible malunion or fracture healing irregularity. The joint spaces appear preserved, and there are no signs of significant osteophyte formation or acute inflammatory changes in the surrounding soft tissues.
