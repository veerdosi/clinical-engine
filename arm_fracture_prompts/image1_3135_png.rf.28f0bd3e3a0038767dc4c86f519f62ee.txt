The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a malalignment and the presence of surgical hardware, including a plate and screws, indicating prior surgical intervention for stabilization. There is evidence of callus formation at the fracture site, suggesting a healing process is underway. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the radius and ulna, indicative of traumatic inflammation.
