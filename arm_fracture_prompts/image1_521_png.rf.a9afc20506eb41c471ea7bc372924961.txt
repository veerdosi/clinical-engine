The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left humerus, which shows the presence of an intramedullary nail with multiple screws. There is notable bone callus formation around the fracture site, indicating a healing process post-fracture fixation. The alignment of the humeral shaft appears satisfactory, although slight varus deformity may be assessed based on the positioning of the implant relative to the anatomical axis.
