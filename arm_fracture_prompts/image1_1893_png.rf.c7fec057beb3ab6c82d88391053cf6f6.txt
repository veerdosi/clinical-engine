The X-ray image presents a right hand with clear visualization of the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notable in the image is a fracture through the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a visible disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there appears to be some soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, indicative of possible acute trauma or inflammation.
