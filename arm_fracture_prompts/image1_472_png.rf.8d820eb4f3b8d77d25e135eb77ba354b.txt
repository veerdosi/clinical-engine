The X-ray image exhibits a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with clear visualization of the prosthetic components in the femoral and tibial regions. There is a symmetrical joint space, indicating that the mechanical alignment appears to be well-maintained, and the cortical bone around the implanted device shows no signs of significant osteolysis. Soft tissue edema is not apparent in the image, which may suggest the absence of an acute inflammatory process or infection surrounding the knee joint.
