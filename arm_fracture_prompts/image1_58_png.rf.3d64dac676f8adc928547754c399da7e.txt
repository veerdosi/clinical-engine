The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna with a focus on the wrist joint, allowing for a detailed visualization of the carpal bones. Notably, there is an apparent alignment issue at the radiocarpal joint, which may suggest the possibility of a distal radial fracture or a misalignment. Additionally, signs of periosteal reaction may be observed, indicating underlying bone stress or potential trauma to the carpal region.
