The X-ray image displays the right forearm, specifically illustrating both the radius and ulna. There is a visible fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a transverse break, which may indicate a recent traumatic event. Surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema, and there could be potential displacement of bone fragments, requiring further assessment for surgical intervention or conservative treatment options.
