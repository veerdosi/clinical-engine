The radiograph presented shows an oblique view of the left hand, specifically highlighting the phalanges of the index finger. Notably, there is a visible angular deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate a possible fracture or dislocation of the proximal phalanx. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling in the adjacent areas, suggesting an underlying trauma or inflammatory process affecting the surrounding structures of the digit.
