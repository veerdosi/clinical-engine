The X-ray image depicts the left wrist and hand, showing the carpal bones and metacarpals in alignment. There appears to be a significant fracture at the distal radius, indicative of a potential Colles' fracture, characterized by dorsal angulation and possible displacement. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may suggest associated contusion or injury to the surrounding structures.
