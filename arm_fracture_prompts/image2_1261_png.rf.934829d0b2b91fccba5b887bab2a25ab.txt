The X-ray image depicted demonstrates an alignment anomaly in the distal femur and proximal tibia, indicative of potential valgus deformity. Notable joint space narrowing is observed, suggesting the presence of degenerative changes in the knee joint, which may indicate osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is an increase in the radiolucency surrounding the knee, possibly signifying the early stages of osteoporosis or bone resorption.
