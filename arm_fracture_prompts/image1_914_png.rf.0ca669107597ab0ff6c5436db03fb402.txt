The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of a hand, with particular focus on the phalanges of the digits. There is a notable radiopaque linear density in one of the proximal phalanges, suggestive of a potential fracture or prior surgical intervention. Joint spaces appear normal, with no signs of osteoarthritis or soft tissue edema visible in the surrounding structures.
