The X-ray image depicts the radiograph of the wrist joint, highlighting the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of increased radiolucency around the lunate bone, which may suggest the presence of avascular necrosis or other underlying pathology affecting the vascular supply to this region. Additionally, slight displacement of the scaphoid and lunate bones is observed, which could indicate a potential ligamentous injury or instability within the carpal structure.
