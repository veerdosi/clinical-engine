The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right hand, highlighting the phalangeal alignment and metacarpal structure. Notably, there is significant joint spacing between the proximal interphalangeal joints, which could suggest the presence of a ligamentous or capsular injury. Additionally, the presence of any sclerotic changes or osteophyte formation at the distal joints may indicate degenerative processes such as osteoarthritis.
