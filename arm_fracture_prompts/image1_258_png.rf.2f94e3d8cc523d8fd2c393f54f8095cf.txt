The image depicts a right elbow joint, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna in lateral view. Notable radiographic findings include the presence of a joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency around the olecranon, which may suggest underlying pathology such as arthritis or trauma. Additionally, there is a slight distal displacement of the radial head, which could be indicative of a possible radial head fracture impacting the integrity of the elbow joint.
