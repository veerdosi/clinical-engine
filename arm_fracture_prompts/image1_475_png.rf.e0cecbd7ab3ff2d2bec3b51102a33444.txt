The X-ray image shows an anteroposterior view of the femur and knee joint, demonstrating a significant angular deformity, likely suggesting genu varum or bowing of the lower extremity. There is evidence of cortical thinning in certain areas of the femoral diaphysis, which could indicate an underlying osteoporotic condition or stress response. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observable at the knee, raising concern for potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
