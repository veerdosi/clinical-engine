The X-ray image displays the right hand with a focus on the phalangeal bones and associated joint structures. Notably, there is evidence of a possible fracture or avulsion at the distal phalanx of the ring finger, characterized by displacement and irregularity in bone contour. Additionally, joint space narrowing at the interphalangeal joints suggests potential arthritic changes, which may contribute to decreased range of motion and functional impairment.
