The X-ray image displays the right forearm, featuring both the radius and ulna in a typical anatomic position. Notably, there are two opacities observed along the distal aspect of the radius, which may indicate the presence of foreign bodies or metallic fragments. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no evidence of edema or soft tissue injury, suggesting that there is no acute traumatic involvement despite the identified opacities.
