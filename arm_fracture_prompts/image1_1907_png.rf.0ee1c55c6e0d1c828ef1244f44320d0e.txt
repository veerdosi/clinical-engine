The image presents an X-ray examination of the left wrist, highlighting the distal radius and ulna. There appears to be a possible fracture or deformity at the distal end of the radius, with signs of potential malalignment or irregular cortical bone density observable. Additionally, there are notable soft tissue changes, possibly indicating swelling or hematoma formation surrounding the injured area, which may suggest traumatic pathology.
