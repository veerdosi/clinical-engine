The X-ray image shows the left shoulder joint with slight displacement of the humerus from the glenoid cavity, indicative of a potential shoulder dislocation. There is an observable fracture in the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may suggest rotator cuff involvement. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling around the joint space, raising suspicion of an inflammatory process or hematoma formation.
