The X-ray image displays the distal radius and the carpal bones of the wrist. Notably, there is a significant radiolucent area adjacent to the lunate bone, which may suggest the presence of a lunate bone abnormality such as Kienb√∂ck's disease, characterized by avascular necrosis. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears altered, indicating possible instability or a previous traumatic event leading to wrist joint dysfunction.
