The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left humerus, revealing a possible humeral shaft fracture characterized by a visible break in the cortical bone continuity. There is associated periosteal reaction indicated by cortical thickening, suggesting a potential healing process or increased reactive changes. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral head appears to be within normal limits, with no signs of dislocation or abnormal joint space observed at the glenohumeral joint.
