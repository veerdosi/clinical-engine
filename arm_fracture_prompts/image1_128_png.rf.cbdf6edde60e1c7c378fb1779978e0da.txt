The X-ray presented shows an oblique view of the humerus, revealing a notable fracture through the mid-shaft region, characterized by a distinct disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggesting associated hematoma formation potentially due to trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the distal fragment appears to be angulated, indicating possible displacement which may necessitate further orthopedic evaluation for alignment and stabilization.
