The X-ray image presents a right hand with clear visualization of the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notable in this image is a possible malalignment of the second metacarpal, which may indicate a fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, suggestive of an underlying acute inflammatory process.
