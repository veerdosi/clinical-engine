The X-ray image depicts the right distal femur and proximal tibia, highlighting the knee joint's anatomical structures. Notably, there is evidence of osteophyte formation at the joint margins, suggesting the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the knee joint appears altered, with potential varus or valgus deformity indicated by the angulation of the bones.
