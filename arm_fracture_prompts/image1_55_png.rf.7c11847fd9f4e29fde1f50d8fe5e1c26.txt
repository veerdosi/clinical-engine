The X-ray image depicts the upper extremity, focusing on the humerus, radius, and ulna, with identifiable bone structures in an anteroposterior view. There is a notable fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a transverse break with possible displacement, suggesting acute trauma. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be apparent around the affected area, indicative of an associated hematoma or inflammation.
