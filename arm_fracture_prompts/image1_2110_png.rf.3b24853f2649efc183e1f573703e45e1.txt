The X-ray reveals a left shoulder with an apparent surgical intervention, evidenced by the presence of metallic hardware, specifically a plate and screws, affixed to the proximal humerus and scapula. There is a suggestive bony irregularity or deformity at the surgical site, which may imply prior trauma or fracture necessitating surgical stabilization. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may show signs of post-operative changes, such as edema, although soft tissue assessment is limited in standard radiographic imaging.
