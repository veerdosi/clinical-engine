The X-ray image depicts the left hand with a focus on the metacarpal and phalangeal bones. Notably, there is an abnormal curvature of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, indicative of a possible deformity such as a boutonni√®re or mallet finger. Additionally, there are signs of degenerative changes in the interphalangeal joints, potentially suggesting osteoarthritis.
