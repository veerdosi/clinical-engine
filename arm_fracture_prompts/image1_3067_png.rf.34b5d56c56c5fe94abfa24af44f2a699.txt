The X-ray image depicts the right wrist and hand, showcasing multiple surgical plates and screws, indicative of an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure performed on the distal radius and possibly involving the carpal bones. There is evidence of bony alignment disruption, suggesting a previous fracture that required surgical intervention to stabilize the wrist structure. Additionally, the presence of hardware demonstrates the attempt to restore anatomical integrity and maintain functional stability in the setting of skeletal trauma.
