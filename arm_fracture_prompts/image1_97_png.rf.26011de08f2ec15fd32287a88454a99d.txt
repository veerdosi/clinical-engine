The image presents a lateral X-ray view of the right elbow joint, revealing a significant angulation at the distal humerus and a possible fracture in the proximal radius. Notably, there appears to be displacement of the radial head, which could suggest a fracture-dislocation pattern commonly associated with elbow injuries. The soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint indicates potential inflammatory changes, which may correspond to trauma or acute injury to the area.
