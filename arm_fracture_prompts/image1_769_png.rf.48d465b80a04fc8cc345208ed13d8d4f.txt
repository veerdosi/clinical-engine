The X-ray image shows the left arm with a clear view of the humerus and elbow region. There is evidence of potential displacement or malalignment of the proximal humerus, which may indicate a fracture or a previous injury. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the elbow area, suggesting possible inflammatory changes or trauma to the joint.
