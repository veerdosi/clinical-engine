The X-ray displays an articulated shoulder joint with an orthopedic plate and screws in situ, indicating a previous surgical intervention, likely due to a fracture or instability of the proximal humerus. Notably, there is a loss of normal bone continuity, suggesting the presence of either post-traumatic changes or a prior corrective procedure. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, but any inflammatory or degenerative changes associated with the surgical site are not assessable through this imaging modality.
