The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right elbow joint, demonstrating the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable in the radiograph are signs of joint effusion, indicated by the radiolucent area surrounding the joint space, which may suggest underlying inflammatory processes. Additionally, there is evidence of possible osteochondral abnormality around the capitellum, which could indicate conditions such as osteochondritis dissecans or other degenerative changes in the articular cartilage.
