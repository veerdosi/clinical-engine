The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting key bony structures including the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible olecranon fracture, characterized by a discontinuity in the bony cortex at the elbow region, suggesting a traumatic injury. Additionally, the radiographic findings show signs of potential soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, indicative of an inflammatory response to the underlying injury.
