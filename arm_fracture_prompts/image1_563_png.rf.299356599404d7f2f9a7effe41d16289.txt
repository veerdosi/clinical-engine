The radiograph depicts a right knee joint, showcasing the femur, tibia, and fibula in a lateral view. Notably, there is a prominence of the medial tibial plateau, suggesting a possible osteophyte formation, which may indicate degenerative joint disease. The joint space appears narrowed, indicative of potential chondromalacia or osteoarthritis-related changes, evidenced by the cortical irregularities along the articular surfaces.
