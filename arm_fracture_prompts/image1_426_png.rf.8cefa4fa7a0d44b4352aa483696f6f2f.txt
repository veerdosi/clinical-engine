The X-ray image depicts the right lower extremity, with particular focus on the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable is the presence of a significant angulation deformity observed in the tibia, which may indicate a potential malalignment or fracture healing aberration. Additionally, the joint spaces are well-defined, but there is a subtle disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting possible pathology or an old fracture line involving the tibia.
