The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the humerus, highlighting the proximal aspects of the bone near the shoulder joint and the glenoid cavity. There is evidence of a significant deformity characterized by an angulated malunion in the mid-shaft region of the humerus, which suggests prior trauma. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the glenohumeral joint space, potentially indicating underlying inflammatory processes or a rotator cuff tear.
