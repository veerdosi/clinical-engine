The X-ray image demonstrates a right humerus with notable signs of an elliptical bone deformity in the distal shaft, which may indicate a chronic condition such as osteogenesis imperfecta or other metabolic bone disorders. There is also evidence of cortical thinning and possible periosteal reaction suggestive of stress response or repetitive strain injury. Additionally, the alignment of the elbow joint appears compromised, indicating potential associated soft tissue or cartilaginous injury.
