The image displays a left knee with a total knee arthroplasty, characterized by the presence of a prosthetic joint implant that replaces the damaged articular surfaces of the femur and tibia. Notably, there is evidence of well-positioned components with no visible signs of periprosthetic fracture or loosening around the implant. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues appear intact, with no indication of joint effusion or significant osteolytic changes.
