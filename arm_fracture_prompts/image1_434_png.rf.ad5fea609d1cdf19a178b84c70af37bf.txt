The X-ray image depicts anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of the right knee joint, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula. The joint space appears well-defined with no visible signs of effusion or significant osteophyte formation, suggesting the absence of advanced osteoarthritis. However, there is a slight subluxation of the patella, which may indicate potential instability or patellofemoral dysfunction.
