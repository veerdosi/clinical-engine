The X-ray of the left knee joint reveals the presence of joint effusion, indicated by a slight widening of the joint space between the femur and tibia. There is also evidence of osteophyte formation around the knee, which suggests potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the femur and tibia appears normal, with no signs of acute fracture or malalignment present.
