The X-ray image displays the anatomic structure of the right hand, revealing the phalanges and metacarpals clearly. Notably, there is a well-defined radiopaque foreign body located within the soft tissues adjacent to the fifth metacarpal, which may suggest prior trauma or surgical intervention. Additionally, no significant fractures or dislocations are observed in the surrounding bones, indicating intact osseous architecture.
