The X-ray image displays the left forearm, including both the radius and ulna, in a supinated position. There is a notable angulation at the mid-shaft of the radius, indicating a possible deformity or fracture. The bone cortices demonstrate an irregular contour, which may suggest underlying pathologies such as osteopenia or previous trauma.
