The X-ray image displays the lateral view of a left elbow joint, revealing the presence of a fixation device, indicative of prior surgical intervention. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture callus formation around the medial and lateral aspects of the humerus, suggesting a healing fracture. The alignment of the ulna appears intact, while the fixation hardware is positioned in a manner consistent with the stabilization of an acute fracture, likely of the distal humerus or proximal ulna.
