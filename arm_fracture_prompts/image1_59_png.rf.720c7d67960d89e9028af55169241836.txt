The X-ray image describes the long bones of the forearm, specifically the ulna and radius. There is a noticeable angulation along the midshaft of the ulna, indicative of a possible olecranon fracture or deformity, which is not congruent with normal anatomical alignment. Additionally, there may be a cortical breach noted in the midsection, suggesting the presence of a fracture line or potential pathological alteration in bony integrity.
