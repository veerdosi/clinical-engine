The X-ray image displays the shoulder joint with a notable decrease in the joint space between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity, indicating possible glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of subchondral sclerosis surrounding the humeral head, which suggests chronic stress on the joint surfaces. Cortical irregularities and potential osteophyte formation along the glenoid rim may further indicate the presence of degenerative changes commonly associated with rotator cuff pathology.
