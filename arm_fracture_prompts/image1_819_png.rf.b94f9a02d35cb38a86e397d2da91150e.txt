The X-ray image reveals a left elbow joint demonstrating an angular deformity with notable displacement of the distal humerus. Metal fixation devices, such as plates and screws, are evident in the ulna, indicating prior surgical intervention for an acute fracture. The joint space appears intact, but there is a possibility of post-traumatic changes in the surrounding soft tissues and bone structure.
