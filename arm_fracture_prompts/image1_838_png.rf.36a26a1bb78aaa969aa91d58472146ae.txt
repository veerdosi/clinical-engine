The X-ray image presents a left lower extremity, specifically showing the femur, patella, and tibia-fibula. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the mid-shaft region of the fibula, characterized by a visible disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is a potential for associated hematoma or soft tissue swelling, which may be indicated by the soft tissue shadow around the fracture site.
