The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the left hand, focusing on the phalangeal structures. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis in the distal interphalangeal joints, suggesting possible osteoarthritis. Additionally, multiple bony protrusions (exostoses) are visible, which may indicate the presence of Heberden's nodes, commonly associated with degenerative joint disease.
