The X-ray image displays anteroposterior and lateral views of the wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal bones and metacarpals. There is evidence of a comminuted fracture of the distal radius with angulation and possible displacement, indicating a significant traumatic injury. Additionally, joint alignment appears compromised, suggesting the potential for an associated fracture-dislocation pattern involving the wrist.
