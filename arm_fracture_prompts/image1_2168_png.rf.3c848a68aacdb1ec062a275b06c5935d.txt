The X-ray image exhibits a significant distortion of the normal anatomy of the wrist and hand, suggesting possible dislocation of the carpometacarpal joints. There is also evidence of a fracture at the base of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by cortical discontinuity and displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted, which may indicate an associated hematoma or inflammatory process surrounding the noted injuries.
