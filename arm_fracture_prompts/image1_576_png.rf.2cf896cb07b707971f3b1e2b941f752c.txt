The radiograph depicts a right knee joint in a lateral view, highlighting the proximal tibia, distal femur, and patella. There is significant joint effusion as evidenced by the increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, which may suggest an inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, there is abnormal bone density observed in the subarticular region of the femur and tibia, potentially indicative of osteonecrosis or avascular changes.
