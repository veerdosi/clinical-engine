The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand, with a particular focus on the third and fourth phalanges. There is evidence of a displaced fracture in the distal phalanx of the third digit, characterized by cortical disruption and alignment issues indicative of potential malunion if not addressed. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site appears to exhibit edema, suggesting acute inflammatory changes and possible hematoma formation.
