The image depicts a lateral radiograph of the right forearm, which includes the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture, characterized by disruption of the cortices and possible angulation at the fracture site, suggesting instability. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius appears altered, which may indicate a displacement associated with the fracture.

Adjacent soft tissues show no apparent swelling or joint effusion in the radiograph, indicating that while there is a fracture, there may be limited acute trauma to the surrounding structures. The presence of bony spurs or irregularities may also indicate previous osseous stress or degenerative changes, though their significance cannot be determined without further clinical correlation. Overall, the radiographic findings suggest a need for further evaluation to assess the extent of injury and any potential complications.
