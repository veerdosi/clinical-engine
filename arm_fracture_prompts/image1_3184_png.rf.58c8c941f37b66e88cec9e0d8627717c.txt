The X-ray image reveals a left distal femur with the presence of an intramedullary nail, indicating prior surgical intervention for likely fracture stabilization. There is evident cortical bone remodeling around the fixation device, suggesting a healing process post-fracture. The alignment of the femur appears maintained; however, any signs of complications such as non-union or malalignment cannot be conclusively determined from the provided image.
