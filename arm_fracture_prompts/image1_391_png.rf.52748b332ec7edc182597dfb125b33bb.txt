The X-ray demonstrates a notable deviation in alignment of the long bones, indicative of a possible angular deformity. There is evidence of subperiosteal bone formation consistent with a chronic pathological process, suggesting underlying osteogenic activity. Additionally, the presence of joint space narrowing may be suggestive of degenerative joint disease or inflammatory arthropathy affecting the adjacent articulations.
