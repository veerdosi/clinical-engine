The X-ray image demonstrates a clear view of the humerus, revealing a potential fracture along the mid-shaft of the bone. There is slight displacement evident at the fracture site, suggesting instability and the possibility of associated soft tissue injury. Additionally, the surrounding periosteum may exhibit signs of thickening, indicative of a healing process or periosteal reaction.
