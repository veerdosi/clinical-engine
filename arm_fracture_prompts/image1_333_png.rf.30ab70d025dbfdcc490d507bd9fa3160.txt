The X-ray image demonstrates multiple views of the right hand, focusing on the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. There is evidence of dislocation at the proximal interphalangeal joints, particularly noted in the second and third fingers, with accompanying soft tissue swelling suggestive of ligamentous injury. Additionally, there are signs of possible fracture in the middle phalanx of the fourth finger, with irregular bone contours observed at the fracture site, indicating a potential break in continuity.
