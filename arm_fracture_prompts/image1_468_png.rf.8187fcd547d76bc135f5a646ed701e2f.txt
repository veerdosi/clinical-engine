The X-ray image demonstrates a distal radius fracture with clear displacement, indicating a loss of alignment at the fracture site. There is also evidence of potential involvement of the ulnar styloid process, which may suggest concomitant injury or instability in the wrist joint. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the fracture area, indicating a possible associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
