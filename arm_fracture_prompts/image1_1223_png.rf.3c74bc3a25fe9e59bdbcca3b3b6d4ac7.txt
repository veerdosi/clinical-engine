The X-ray image appears to show the distal aspect of the humerus in a lateral projection, revealing an abnormal radiolucent area consistent with a potential osteolytic lesion. There is a noticeable irregularity at the joint interface, which may suggest a condition such as a bone tumor or infection. Additionally, the presence of swelling in the surrounding soft tissues and any joint effusion could indicate an inflammatory process or degenerative joint disease.
