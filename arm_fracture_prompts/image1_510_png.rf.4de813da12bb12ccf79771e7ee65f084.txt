The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and associated periosteal reaction. Additionally, the wrist joint alignment appears normal, but there may be potential soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, indicating an acute injurious event.
