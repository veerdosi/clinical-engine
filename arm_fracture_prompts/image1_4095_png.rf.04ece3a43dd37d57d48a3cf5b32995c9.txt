The image shows an anteroposterior view of the left shoulder joint, highlighting the presence of a humeral head prosthesis, which suggests a history of surgical intervention such as total shoulder arthroplasty. There is notable radiolucency surrounding the prosthesis, indicating possible osteolysis or poor bony integration with the implant. Additionally, the glenoid cavity may exhibit signs of wear or degenerative changes, consistent with underlying arthropathy.
