The X-ray image shows the bones of the forearm and wrist in a lateral view, revealing a fracture involving the distal radius. There is also evidence of significant swelling in the soft tissues surrounding the fracture site, indicative of post-traumatic edema. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears to be compromised, suggesting a possible associated injury to the wrist joint.
