The X-ray image demonstrates the left elbow joint, revealing a significant effusion in the joint space, which may suggest the presence of a joint pathology such as synovitis or bursitis.

Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear to be edematous, which may suggest inflammation or injury to the periarticular structures.
