The image shows an X-ray of the right shoulder joint, highlighting a lateral view of the humerus and surrounding anatomical structures. Notably, there is a radiolucent line observed along the proximal aspect of the humerus, which may indicate a possible fracture or avulsion. Additionally, there appears to be joint effusion within the glenohumeral joint, suggesting potential underlying pathology such as rotator cuff injury or tendinitis.
