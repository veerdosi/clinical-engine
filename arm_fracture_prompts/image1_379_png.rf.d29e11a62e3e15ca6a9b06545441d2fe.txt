The X-ray image presented shows an orthogonal view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the fingers. There is evidence of a potential phalangeal fracture involving one or more of the distal phalanges, characterized by cortical discontinuity and possible soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there may be signs of malalignment within the finger joints, indicating a potential dislocation or subluxation in the affected area.
