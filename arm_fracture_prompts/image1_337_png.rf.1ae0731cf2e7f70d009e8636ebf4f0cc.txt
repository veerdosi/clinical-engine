The X-ray image exhibits a clear view of the forearm and hand, revealing the anatomical structures of the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is a pronounced fracture of the distal radius with evidence of dorsal angulation, indicative of a possible Colles' fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling surrounding the injury suggests an acute inflammatory response, which may accompany such traumatic injuries.
