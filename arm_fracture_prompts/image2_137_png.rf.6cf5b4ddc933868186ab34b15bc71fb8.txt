The X-ray image displays the right forearm in a posteroanterior (PA) view, capturing both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone and displacement, suggesting a potential diaphyseal injury. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears intact, but further assessment is necessary to evaluate for associated soft tissue injuries or complications.
