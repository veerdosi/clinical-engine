The X-ray of the hand demonstrates the presence of a well-defined lytic lesion in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, suggestive of a potential osseous pathology. There is evidence of cortical thinning surrounding the lesion, which may indicate a localized process affecting bone integrity. The alignment of the metacarpals appears within normal limits, with no acute fracture or dislocation noted in the surrounding structures.
