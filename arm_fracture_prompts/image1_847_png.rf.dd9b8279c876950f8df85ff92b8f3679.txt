The X-ray image presented depicts a lateral view of the right knee joint, illustrating the femur and proximal tibia. Notably, there is a visible osteophyte formation at the superior aspect of the patella, suggestive of osteoarthritis in the joint. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observed, indicative of degenerative changes associated with chronic knee pathology.
