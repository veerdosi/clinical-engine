The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the knee joint, where the femur, tibia, and fibula are clearly visible. There is a noticeable angulation in the alignment of the tibia, suggesting a potential genu varum or genu valgum deformity. Additional attention should be directed to the joint space between the femur and tibia, as narrowing may indicate osteoarthritis or potential joint degeneration.
