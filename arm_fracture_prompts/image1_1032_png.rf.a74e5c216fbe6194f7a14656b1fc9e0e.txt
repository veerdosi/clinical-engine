The X-ray image demonstrates a potential fracture in the lateral aspect of the distal femur, specifically near the knee joint. There is evident displacement of the bone fragments, which may indicate the presence of an unstable fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted in the surrounding area, suggestive of possible associated hematoma or edema.
