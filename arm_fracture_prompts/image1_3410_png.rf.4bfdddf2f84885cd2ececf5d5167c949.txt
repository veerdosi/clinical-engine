The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the left elbow joint, with notable surgical intervention evident through the presence of a metallic fixation device, likely a screw, inserted in the vicinity of the ulnar region. There are signs of post-surgical changes around the fixation site, including potential callus formation indicative of the healing process following an osteosynthesis procedure. The alignment of the ulnar and radial bones appears within normal anatomical limits, with no evidence of acute fractures or dislocations seen in this projection.
