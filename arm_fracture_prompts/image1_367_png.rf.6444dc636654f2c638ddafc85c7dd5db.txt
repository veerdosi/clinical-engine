The X-ray image presents an oblique view of the right forearm, showcasing the distal radius and ulna. There is a noticeable displacement at the distal radius, indicative of a fracture, potentially a Colles' fracture, characterized by dorsal angulation.

Additionally, the image reveals signs of radiographic changes in the adjacent joint structures, suggesting the potential presence of associated soft tissue injury. The alignment of the bones and overall integrity appear compromised, warranting further clinical evaluation for the assessment of stability and treatment options.
