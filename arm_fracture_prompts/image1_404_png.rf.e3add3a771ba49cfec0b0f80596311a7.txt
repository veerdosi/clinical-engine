The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the presence of a fixation plate along the diaphysis of the humerus. Notably, there appears to be a healed diaphyseal fracture, indicated by the presence of callus formation adjacent to the fracture site, associated with the metallic hardware. The alignment of the humerus appears acceptable, with no evidence of malunion or nonunion observed in this view.
