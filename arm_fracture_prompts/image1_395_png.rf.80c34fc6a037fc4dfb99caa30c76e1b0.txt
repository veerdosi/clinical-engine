The X-ray image depicts the left wrist, highlighting the carpal bones and the proximal metacarpals. There appears to be a significant alteration in the normal anatomy, particularly noticeable in the scaphoid bone, which may suggest the presence of a fracture or non-union. Additionally, there is evidence of irregularities in the articular surfaces, raising concerns for potential osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes in the wrist joint.
