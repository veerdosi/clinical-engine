The X-ray image reveals an abnormal appearance of the left knee joint, specifically noting the joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis. There is also evidence of subchondral bone sclerosis, indicative of degenerative changes often associated with chronic stress or wear. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes along the margins of the femoral condyles further supports a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease.
