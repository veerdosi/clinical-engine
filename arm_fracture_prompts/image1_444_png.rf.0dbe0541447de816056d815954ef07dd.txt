The X-ray image depicts the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal structures of the fingers. Notable is a malalignment of the distal phalanx of the index finger, which suggests a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing in the proximal interphalangeal joints, potentially indicating arthritic changes.
