The X-ray image depicts the right wrist, showcasing multiple metallic fixation devices within the distal radius and ulnar regions. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by displacement and delineation of the cortical bone, suggesting a post-operative stabilization procedure. The presence of these fixation elements indicates a surgical intervention aimed at maintaining alignment and facilitating the healing process of the bony structures involved.
