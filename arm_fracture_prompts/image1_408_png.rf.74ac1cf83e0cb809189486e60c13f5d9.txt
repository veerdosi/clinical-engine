The X-ray image displays an internal fixation device, specifically a plate with screws, applied to the femur. There is evidence of a contoured fracture line in the mid-shaft region of the femur, indicating a previous bone disruption or fracture. Surrounding the fixation hardware, there may be signs of callus formation, which suggests the healing response of the bone.
