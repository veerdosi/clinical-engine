The X-ray image displays the phalangeal bones of a finger with a notable angulation at the distal interphalangeal joint, suggesting a possible malalignment of the distal phalanx. There appears to be subluxation, characterized by the displacement of the joint surfaces, indicative of a potential traumatic injury. Additionally, there is evidence of cortical bone irregularity, which may suggest underlying pathology such as fractures or erosive changes.
