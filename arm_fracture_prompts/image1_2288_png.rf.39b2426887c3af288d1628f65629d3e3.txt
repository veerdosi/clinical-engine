The X-ray image demonstrates an incongruence at the radiocarpal joint, suggestive of possible osteoarthritis characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. There is also evidence of a potential fracture or malalignment involving the distal radius, indicated by abnormal angulation and cortical disruption. Furthermore, associated soft tissue swelling may be present, which is often indicative of inflammation or edema around the joint structures.
