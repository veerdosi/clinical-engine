The radiographic image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, emphasizing their alignment and integrity. Notably, there appears to be a significant cortical disruption indicating a possible fracture or stress injury, particularly in the mid-shaft of the radius. Additionally, there may be signs of surrounding soft tissue edema or effusion, which could suggest an inflammatory process secondary to the bony abnormality.
