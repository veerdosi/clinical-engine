The X-ray image reveals a right hand with notable signs of congenital malformation in the phalanges, particularly across the second digit, which exhibits duplications in the distal phalanx. There is also evidence of osteopenia in the metacarpals, suggesting a potential deficiency in bone mineral density. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed, which may indicate early signs of degenerative changes potentially affecting the interphalangeal joints.
