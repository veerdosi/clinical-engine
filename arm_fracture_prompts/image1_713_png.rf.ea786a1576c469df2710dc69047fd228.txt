The x-ray image displays the left knee joint, highlighting the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and fibula in an AP view. There is evidence of osteophyte formation at the joint margins, indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are no acute fractures, but the alignment of the joint suggests potential varus or valgus deformity.
