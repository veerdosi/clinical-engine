The X-ray depicts a right knee joint with a notable presence of joint effusion, suggesting the accumulation of excess synovial fluid within the articular cavity. There is also evidence of osteophyte formation at the medial and lateral aspects of the joint, indicating potential osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, alignment of the femoral condyles appears altered, which may suggest an underlying deformity or misalignment, possibly contributing to functional limitations.
