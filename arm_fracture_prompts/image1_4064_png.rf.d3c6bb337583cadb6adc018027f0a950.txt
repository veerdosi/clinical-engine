The X-ray image depicts an elbow joint where there is evident lateral displacement of the radial head, indicative of a possible fracture-dislocation. The presence of joint effusion is suggested by the abnormal lucency around the joint space, which may be associated with trauma or inflammatory processes. Additionally, there is cortical disruption noted along the ulnar shaft, consistent with a potential fracture, further warranting clinical correlation for definitive diagnosis.
