The X-ray image displays the knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable is the presence of joint space narrowing, indicative of potential osteoarthritis, along with marginal osteophyte formation at the patellofemoral joint. Additionally, there is evidence of subchondral sclerosis, which may suggest early degenerative changes within the articular cartilage.
