The X-ray image reveals a right elbow in a flexed position, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable is the joint space at the humero-ulnar joint, which appears to have irregularities potentially indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing. Additionally, the presence of subcortical bone sclerosis may suggest underlying pathology such as chondromalacia or osteophyte formation adjacent to the joint surfaces.
