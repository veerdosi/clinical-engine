The X-ray image depicts a left forearm post-reduction, showing alignment of the distal radius and ulna after an intervention. There is evidence of a previous fracture noted at the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and potential angulation, indicating the presence of a fracture malalignment prior to reduction. The soft tissue surrounding the fracture site appears normal without any significant edema or hematoma visible on the image, suggesting a stable post-reduction status.
