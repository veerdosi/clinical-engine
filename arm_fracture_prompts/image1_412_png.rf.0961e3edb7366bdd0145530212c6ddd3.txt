The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left humerus, highlighting the proximal humeral region and glenohumeral joint. There is evidence of a potential proximal humeral fracture characterized by disrupted cortical continuity and irregularity in the humeral head contour. Additionally, there may be signs of osteopenia since the surrounding trabecular bone appears less dense, which could indicate a pathological state affecting bone mineralization.
