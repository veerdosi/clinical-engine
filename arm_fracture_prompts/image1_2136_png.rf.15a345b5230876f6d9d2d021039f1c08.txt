The X-ray image reveals the wrist joint with visible bony structures, including the radius and ulna, as well as the carpal bones. There appears to be an abnormality in the alignment of the carpal bones, which may indicate a potential dislocation or malposition. Additionally, signs of osteoarthritic changes could be noted, such as joint space narrowing or subchondral sclerosis in the articulating surfaces.
