The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of the hand, revealing the phalangeal alignment and overall bone integrity. There is evidence of a significant fracture at the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and potential displacement. Additionally, the presence of joint effusion is noted at the metacarpophalangeal joint, indicating possible associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory process.
