The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left femur and knee joint, showing normal anatomical alignment of the femur, patella, and tibia. There is noted periosteal reaction along the femoral diaphysis, suggesting possible underlying pathology or irritation. Additionally, there is a soft tissue mass located adjacent to the knee joint, raising the suspicion for a potential tumor or cyst formation.
