The radiograph of the right shoulder demonstrates a prominent acromion with potential subacromial impingement, which could indicate a rotator cuff pathology. There is evidence of cortical irregularity at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, suggestive of possible tendinopathy or previous rotator cuff tear. Additionally, joint space narrowing is visible, which may signify underlying osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint.
