The X-ray image reveals a notable deformity in the proximal humerus, characterized by irregular bony architecture and the presence of an angulated fracture. There is significant distortion of the normal anatomical alignment of the humerus, leading to potential complications in shoulder mobility. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue edema may be evident, indicating possible inflammatory changes associated with the fracture.
