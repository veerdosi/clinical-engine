The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right hand, with particular emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is notable idiopathic osteolysis observed in the distal phalanges, characterized by the presence of cortical thinning and reduction in bone density. Additionally, there may be evidence of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling around the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggesting potential inflammatory or degenerative pathology.
