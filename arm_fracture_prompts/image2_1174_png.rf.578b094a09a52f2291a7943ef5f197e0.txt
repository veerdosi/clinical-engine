The X-ray image depicts the right humerus, illustrating a possible mid-shaft fracture characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There are signs of possible callus formation surrounding the fracture site, indicating a healing process that may be underway. Additionally, there appears to be a slight angulation of the distal fragment suggesting a degree of malalignment in the fracture.
