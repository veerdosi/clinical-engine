The X-ray image depicts the forearm, specifically illustrating the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a midshaft fracture in the radius, characterized by posterior angulation and displacement, while the ulna appears intact with no signs of fracture or deformity. No signs of osteolytic lesions or other pathological conditions are visible in the surrounding soft tissues.
