The X-ray images presented show the left forearm, including the radius and ulna, in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. There is evidence of a diaphyseal fracture in the radius, characterized by a complete break and displacement, suggesting a potential instability in the alignment of the forearm bones. Additionally, cortical disruption and periosteal reaction may be observed, indicating the presence of associated soft tissue trauma or edema in the surrounding region.
