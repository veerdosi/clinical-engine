The x-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal femur, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity of the bone. Adjacent to the fracture site, there is evidence of localized soft tissue swelling, which may indicate the presence of a hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the knee joint appears compromised, suggesting potential involvement of the proximal tibia or femoral condyles.
