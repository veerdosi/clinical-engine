The X-ray image depicts the phalangeal bones of the hand, specifically focusing on the proximal phalanx of the thumb. Notably, there are metallic fixation screws present, indicating a history of surgical intervention, likely due to an intra-articular fracture of the thumb. The alignment of the bony structures appears acceptable, but the presence of hardware suggests a previous injury requiring stabilization.
