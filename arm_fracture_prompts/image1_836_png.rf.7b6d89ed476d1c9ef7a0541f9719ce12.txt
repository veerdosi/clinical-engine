The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left hand, with particular attention to the proximal and distal phalanges of the index finger. Notable is the presence of a potential fracture in the distal phalanx, evidenced by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and altered alignment of the phalangeal joint. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling around the affected digit, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
