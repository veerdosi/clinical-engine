The X-ray image displays the upper and lower arm, illustrating the humerus and radius/ulna bones. Notably, there is an evident evidence of a fracture, characterized by an interruption in the cortical continuity, which may require further assessment for alignment and stability. Additionally, there may be signs of callus formation around the fracture site, indicating a healing response, and potential soft tissue edema could be present adjacent to the affected area.
