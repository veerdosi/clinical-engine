The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the mid-shaft of the ulna, characterized by a non-displaced alignment. Notably, there is evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, suggesting an inflammatory response. Additionally, the distal radius appears intact, indicating that the injury is primarily localized to the ulnar shaft.
