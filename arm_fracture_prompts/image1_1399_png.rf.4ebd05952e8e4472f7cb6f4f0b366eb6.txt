The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus, revealing a potential fracture or deformity in the area of the surgical neck. The glenohumeral joint appears to be intact, but there is notable irregularity in the cortical bone structure, suggesting possible pathologic changes such as osteopenia or periosteal reaction. No evidence of joint effusion is observed; however, slight soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the shoulder region based on the radiographic presentation.
