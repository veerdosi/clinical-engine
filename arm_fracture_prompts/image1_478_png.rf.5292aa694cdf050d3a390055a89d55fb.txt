The X-ray image displays the right knee joint in a lateral view, showing the femur, patella, and tibia in a single plane. Notable findings include the presence of osteophytes at the medial aspect of the knee, indicative of osteoarthritis, which may result in joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there is evidence of effusion within the joint space, potentially suggestive of inflammatory processes or a response to chronic mechanical stress.
