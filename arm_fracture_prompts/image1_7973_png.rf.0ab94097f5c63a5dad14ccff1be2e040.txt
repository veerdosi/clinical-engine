The X-ray image demonstrates the right shoulder joint, highlighting the proximal humerus with an apparent surgical fixation device in place, suggesting a previous intervention for a fracture. The presence of multiple fixation screws indicates an attempt to stabilize a fracture or perhaps address a significant osteotomy. Additionally, there may be noticeable changes in the bone architecture surrounding the area of fixation, possibly indicative of remodeling following a healing process.
