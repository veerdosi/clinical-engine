The X-ray image demonstrates a forearm radiograph, revealing the presence of a metallic implant, indicative of prior surgical intervention. There is a notable appearance of bone deformity in the distal radius, potentially suggestive of a previous fracture that has required fixation. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, which may indicate malunion or nonunion associated with the underlying pathology.
