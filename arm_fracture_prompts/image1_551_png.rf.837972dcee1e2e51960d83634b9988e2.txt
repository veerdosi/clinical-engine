The image presents a radiograph of the left wrist and hand, demonstrating the carpal bones and the metacarpal phalangeal joints. Notably, there is a potential misalignment of the fifth metacarpal, which could indicate a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma.
