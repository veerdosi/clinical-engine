The image displays a radiographic view of the right elbow with an intramedullary device in place, indicating a history of surgical intervention likely due to an acute fracture or osteotomy. There is notable displacement of the radius and ulna, coupled with effusion in the joint space, which may suggest post-traumatic arthritis or synovitis. Additionally, cortical irregularity along the bone surfaces further implies complications such as a non-union or malunion at the site of previous fracture fixation.
