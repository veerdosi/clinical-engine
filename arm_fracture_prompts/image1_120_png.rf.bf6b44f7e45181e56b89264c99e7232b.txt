The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the scapula, clavicle, and proximal humerus. Notably, there is evidence of a potential glenohumeral joint dislocation, characterized by the displacement of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, the surrounding osseous structures show signs of degenerative changes, which may suggest underlying osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology.
