The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left shoulder and upper arm, showcasing both the humeral head and the glenohumeral joint. There is evidence of a potential fracture or dislocation at the proximal humerus, characterized by misalignment and irregularity in the bone cortex. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling may be observed surrounding the affected area, which could indicate an associated hematoma or synovitis.

The glenoid fossa appears intact, but subtle irregularities in the bony contour of the humerus might suggest a possible osteolytic process or early signs of degenerative changes. Examination of the surrounding soft tissues is necessary to assess any damage to the rotator cuff or other ligamentous structures. Further evaluation may include an MRI to clarify the extent of the injury and any associated intra-articular pathology.
