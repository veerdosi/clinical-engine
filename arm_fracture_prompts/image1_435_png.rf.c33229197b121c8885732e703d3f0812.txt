The X-ray image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia, highlighting the knee joint. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by subchondral sclerosis and the presence of osteophytes along the articular surfaces. Additionally, areas of increased radiolucency surrounding the joint may indicate potential bone marrow edema or localized osteopenia, warranting further clinical evaluation for underlying pathology.
