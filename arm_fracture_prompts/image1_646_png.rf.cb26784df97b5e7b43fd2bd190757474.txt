The X-ray image of the right hand displays the phalanges and metacarpal bones, with a notable abnormality present. There appears to be evidence of osteoarthritic changes at the distal interphalangeal joints, characterized by joint space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation. Additionally, the alignment of the second and third digits suggests a possible deformity, with any flattening or angular deformity potentially indicating an underlying condition affecting the skeletal integrity.
