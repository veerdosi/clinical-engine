The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and ulna, showcasing the wrist joint and proximal carpal bones. Notably, there is a fracture evident in the distal radius, characterized by a transverse line that disrupts the cortical bone continuity. Surrounding edema may be observed, indicating potential soft tissue involvement or inflammatory response in the surrounding areas of the wrist joint.
