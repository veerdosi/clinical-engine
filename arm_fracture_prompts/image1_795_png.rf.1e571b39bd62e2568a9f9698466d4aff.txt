The X-ray image presented displays the right leg, including the femur, tibia, and fibula, with clear visualization of the knee joint. There appears to be a notable alignment issue with the knee joint, which suggests possible varus or valgus deformity, impacting the overall limb axis. Additionally, there may be indicative signs of osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, observable in the arrangement of the structures around the knee.
