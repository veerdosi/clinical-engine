The X-ray image depicts a left wrist with evidence of a surgical fixation device, likely indicating a previous fracture that has required stabilization. The positioning of the plate suggests that there has been an intervention to address malalignment or instability of the distal radius or surrounding carpal bones. Radiographic evaluation shows the presence of metallic hardware and potential signs of callus formation around the fracture site, which may indicate the healing process post-surgery.
