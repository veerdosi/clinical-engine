The x-ray image displays the bony structures of the wrist and hand, illustrating the alignment and integrity of the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable in the image is the presence of a potential fracture in one of the metacarpal bones, characterized by a distinct discontinuity in the cortical margin. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected area, which may indicate an associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory process.
