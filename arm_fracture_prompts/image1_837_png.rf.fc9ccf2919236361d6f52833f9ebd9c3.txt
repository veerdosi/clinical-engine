The X-ray image shows a right tibia, displaying normal alignment with no evidence of an acute fracture. There is a notable lucency observed in the proximal aspect of the bone, which may suggest the presence of an underlying pathological process such as osteomyelitis or a benign bone lesion. Additionally, the joint surfaces at the knee appear intact, without any signs of degenerative joint disease or abnormal osteophyte formation.
