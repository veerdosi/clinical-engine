The X-ray image displays the right forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna with clear visibility of the proximal and distal ends. Notably, there is an observable fracture characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity of the affected bone, indicating instability and potential misalignment. Additionally, signs of edema in the surrounding soft tissues may suggest an inflammatory response related to the fracture.
