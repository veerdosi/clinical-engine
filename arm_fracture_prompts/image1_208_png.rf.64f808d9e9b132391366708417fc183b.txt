The X-ray shows a right wrist with notable findings in the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a displacement observed in the scaphoid bone, indicative of a potential scaphoid fracture, which can often lead to osteonecrosis if not promptly treated. Additionally, there appears to be irregularity in the distal radius, suggesting the possibility of a distal radius fracture or fracture healing abnormalities.
