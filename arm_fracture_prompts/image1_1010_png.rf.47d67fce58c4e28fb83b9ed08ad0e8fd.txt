The image depicts an X-ray of the right lower extremity, specifically focusing on the femur and the proximal tibia. There is notable displacement and angulation of the distal femur, suggestive of a fracture, which appears to be accompanied by a periosteal reaction. Additionally, the joint spaces are preserved, indicating that there is no significant effusion or acute articular involvement observed at this time.
