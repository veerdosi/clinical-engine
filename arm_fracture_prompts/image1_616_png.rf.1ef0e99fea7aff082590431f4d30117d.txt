The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing the presence of two metallic Kirschner wires (K-wires) crossing within the proximal forearm region. There is evidence of osseous disruption, indicative of a fracture line traversing the radius or ulna, which is consistent with an unstable fracture pattern requiring stabilization. Soft tissue swelling may also be inferred from the periarticular shadows, suggesting potential edema or hematoma formation surrounding the injured area.
