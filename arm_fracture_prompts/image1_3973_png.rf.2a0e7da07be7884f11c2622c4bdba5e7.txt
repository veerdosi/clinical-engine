The image shows a lateral X-ray view of the elbow joint, which displays the presence of surgical hardware, including screws and plates, indicating prior surgical intervention. There is evidence of a heterotopic ossification process adjacent to the joint, characterized by the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissue. Additionally, the alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna appears to be affected, suggesting potential deformity or malunion of the distal humerus fracture.
