The X-ray image depicts the distal radioulnar joint and the carpal bones of the wrist, with clear visualization of the anatomical structures involved. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a clear discontinuity in the cortical bone, which may indicate an acute traumatic injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present around the injured area, suggesting an inflammatory response possibly associated with the fracture.
