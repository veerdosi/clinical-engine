The X-ray image demonstrates the carpal bones of the wrist, revealing a normal alignment and joint space without any evidence of acute fractures or dislocations. However, there is noted joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, suggesting possible underlying inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or other arthropathies. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation at the distal radii may indicate early degenerative changes, potentially characteristic of osteoarthritis.
