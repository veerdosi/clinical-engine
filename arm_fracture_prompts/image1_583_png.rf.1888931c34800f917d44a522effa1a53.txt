The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right elbow joint, illustrating the olecranon, trochlea, and the distal humerus. Notable is the presence of a bony deformity suggestive of a possible olecranon fracture or degeneration, with irregularity observed along the contour of the olecranon process. Additional assessment of soft tissue structures adjacent to the joint may indicate signs of edema or inflammation consistent with post-traumatic changes or chronic joint pathology.
