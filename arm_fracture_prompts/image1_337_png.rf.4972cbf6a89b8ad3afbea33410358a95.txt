The x-ray image demonstrates a clear fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and significant displacement. Additionally, there are signs of potential soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate an associated hematoma. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no visible signs of dislocation or other acute bony injuries in the wrist region.
