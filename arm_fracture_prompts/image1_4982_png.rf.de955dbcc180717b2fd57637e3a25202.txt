The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right elbow joint, showing moderate osteoarthritic changes characterized by joint space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation. There is evidence of irregularity along the contours of the distal humerus and proximal radius, indicating possible degenerative joint disease. Additionally, subtle subchondral sclerosis may be visible, suggesting chronic stress or wear in the surrounding bone structures.
