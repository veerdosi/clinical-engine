The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the left hand, with particular emphasis on the distal phalanx of the index finger. There is an observable fracture through the shaft of the distal phalanx, characterized by an angular displacement, consistent with a potential malalignment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the injury site, suggesting an accompanying contusion or hematoma.
