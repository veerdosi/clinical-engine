The X-ray image depicted shows the right shoulder joint, with particular focus on the proximal humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Notably, there is evidence of significant osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis near the glenoid, indicating degenerative changes. Additionally, there are possible signs of a rotator cuff tear, as evidenced by the irregularity in the greater tuberosity of the humerus and increased radiolucency around the cuff tendons.
