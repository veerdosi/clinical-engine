The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the knee joint, showing an abnormal alignment of the femur and tibia, indicative of potential valgus or varus deformities. There is evidence of joint effusion, as seen by the swelling of the suprapatellar region, along with possible osteophyte formation around the femoral condyles, suggesting degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis in the distal femur and proximal tibia reflects underlying bone remodeling associated with chronic mechanical stress on the joint.
