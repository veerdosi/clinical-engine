The X-ray image demonstrates the right shoulder joint, including the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding soft tissues. There is evidence of potential degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subcortical sclerosis. Additionally, a prominent acromion is noted, which may indicate the presence of an impingement syndrome, potentially affecting the subacromial space and rotator cuff integrity.
