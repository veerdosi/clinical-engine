The x-ray image displays the forearm anatomy, including the radius and ulna. There is observable angulation in the mid-shaft of the ulna, indicative of a potential fracture or deformity in this region. Additionally, the integrity of the distal radioulnar joint appears compromised, suggesting possible joint instability or a related injury.
