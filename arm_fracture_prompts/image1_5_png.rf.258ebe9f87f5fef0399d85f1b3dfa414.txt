The X-ray image demonstrates the lateral view of the elbow joint, illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture at the distal end of the humerus, characterized by irregular cortical margins and altered trabecular patterns. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion, as indicated by the increased radiolucency surrounding the olecranon fossa, suggestive of possible inflammatory changes or trauma.
