The X-ray image reveals a prominent fracture in the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by a significant disruption of the cortical bone integrity. There is evidence of callus formation surrounding the fracture site, indicating an ongoing healing process. Additionally, the alignment of the humerus appears to be malaligned, suggesting potential complications such as nonunion or malunion.
