The X-ray image presents the right hand, depicting the distal phalanges, proximal phalanges, and metacarpal bones. Notable is the presence of potential bone misalignment as well as signs indicative of possible osteoarthritis, characterized by decreased joint space and marginal osteophyte formation at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling, which may suggest an inflammatory process affecting the surrounding structures.
