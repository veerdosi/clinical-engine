The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting both the radius and the ulna. There is evident cortical disruption in the midshaft region of the radius, suggestive of an acute diaphyseal fracture, with possible bowing deformity observed in the radius. No significant signs of joint effusion or acute osseous lesions are noted in the associated distal radioulnar and elbow joints.
