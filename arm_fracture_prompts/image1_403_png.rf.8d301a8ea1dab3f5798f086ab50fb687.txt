The image shows an X-ray of the left upper extremity, specifically focusing on the humerus and surrounding structures. Notably, there is evidence of a significant angular deformity along the shaft of the humerus, suggesting potential malunion or nonunion of a prior fracture. Additionally, there is associated soft tissue swelling observable, indicating a possible inflammatory process or trauma in the proximal region of the arm.
