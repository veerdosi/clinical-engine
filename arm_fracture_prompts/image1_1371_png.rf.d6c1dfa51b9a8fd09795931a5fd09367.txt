The x-ray demonstrates the glenohumeral joint, highlighting the proximal humerus and the scapula. There is a notable presence of an osteophyte formation along the inferior aspect of the acromion, which may suggest the development of subacromial impingement syndrome. Additionally, the morphology of the distal clavicle appears altered, indicating potential degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis at the acromioclavicular joint.
