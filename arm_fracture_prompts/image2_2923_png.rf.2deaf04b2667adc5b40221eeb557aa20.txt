The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, showcasing the humerus, scapula, and clavicle in a lateral view. There is a significant displacement of the proximal humerus, which may indicate a possible humeral head fracture or dislocation. The surrounding soft tissues appear normal, but the joint space is narrowed, suggesting potential degenerative changes or joint effusion.
