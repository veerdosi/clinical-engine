The X-ray image shows the humerus, exhibiting a potential diaphyseal fracture characterized by a transverse line across the mid-shaft. There are no visible signs of callus formation, suggesting that the fracture may be recent. Additional observation reveals possible soft tissue swelling surrounding the area, indicating inflammation that could be associated with the injury.
