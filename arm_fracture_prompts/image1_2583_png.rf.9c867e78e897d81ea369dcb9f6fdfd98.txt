The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right knee joint, which reveals the presence of internal fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, indicative of a previous surgical intervention. Abnormal bone alignment and malunion may be evident, particularly in the distal femur and proximal tibia region, suggesting a history of fracture that has required surgical fixation. Additionally, there may be signs of callus formation around the fracture site, which can be associated with the healing process, yet it also emphasizes the complexity of the previous injury.
