The X-ray image displays the right wrist joint, specifically highlighting the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones. Notable in this radiograph is a potential fracture line along the distal radius, indicative of a possible fracture sustained in the context of trauma. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling surrounding the wrist joint, which could suggest inflammatory or traumatic pathology.
