The radiograph demonstrates an adult hand in a standard anteroposterior view. There is evidence of potential joint effusion in the metacarpophalangeal joints, along with irregularities in the cortical margins of the proximal phalanx suggesting possible osteoarthritic changes. Additionally, there appear to be signs of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected joints, which could indicate underlying inflammatory processes.
