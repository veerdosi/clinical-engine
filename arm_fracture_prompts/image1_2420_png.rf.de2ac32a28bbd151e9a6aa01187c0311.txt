The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. There is evidence of joint space narrowing at the base of the first metacarpal, suggestive of osteoarthritis in this region. Additionally, the presence of subchondral bone sclerosis along with osteophyte formation may indicate chronic degenerative changes in the joint structures.
