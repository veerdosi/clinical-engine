The X-ray image displayed shows the right elbow joint in a lateral view, highlighting both the humerus and the ulna. There is a noticeable formation of an angular deformity or malalignment at the joint, suggesting potential angular deformity such as cubitus varus or cubitus valgus. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, which may indicate the presence of degenerative changes or joint effusion.

Furthermore, the radiograph reveals an area of irregularity around the capitellum, raising suspicion for possible osteochondritis dissecans or other pathological conditions affecting the articular surface. The soft tissue surrounding the elbow appears unremarkable; however, any associated swelling or effusion would require clinical correlation for a more comprehensive evaluation. Overall, the image warrants further investigation to determine the underlying etiology of the observed abnormalities.
