The image depicts an X-ray of the right hand, specifically showcasing the phalanges of the fifth digit (little finger). There appears to be a noticeable fracture in the distal phalanx, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, indicating a possible acute injury. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the affected area, suggesting concomitant soft tissue damage commonly associated with traumatic injuries.
