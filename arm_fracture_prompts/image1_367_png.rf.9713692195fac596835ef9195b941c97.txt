The X-ray image displays a right hand in a digital radiograph, with the thumb extended and the remaining fingers partially flexed. Notable in this image is the potential presence of a deformity or misalignment in the proximal interphalangeal joints, particularly in the middle finger, suggestive of an angular deformity. Additionally, there may be evidence of soft tissue edema surrounding the affected joint, which could indicate inflammation or trauma in the area.
