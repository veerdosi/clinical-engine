The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the shoulder joint, revealing potential changes in the acromion and proximal humerus. There is evidence of joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation, which may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a potential subacromial spur, which could contribute to impingement syndrome in the subacromial space.
