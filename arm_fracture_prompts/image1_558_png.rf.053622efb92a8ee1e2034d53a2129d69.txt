The X-ray image displays the right wrist, revealing a notable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. There are signs of misalignment at the wrist joint, suggestive of possible lunate or scaphoid involvement, which are critical for maintaining wrist stability and function. The surrounding soft tissues show no acute signs of edema or effusion, but close monitoring is warranted for potential complications related to the fracture.
