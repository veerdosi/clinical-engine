The X-ray image of the right knee joint reveals a potential joint effusion, indicated by the presence of increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar pouch. Notably, the overall joint architecture appears preserved; however, there is a mild flattening of the patellar surface, which may suggest early signs of patellofemoral arthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the femur and tibia appears normal, with no acute fractures or dislocations evident in this view.
