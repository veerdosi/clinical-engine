The radiographic image depicts the left hand, revealing an oblique view of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges of the fingers. Notably, there is an elongated foreign object, likely an implant or fragment, located subcutaneously adjacent to the ring finger, which may indicate prior surgical intervention or traumatic injury. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears normal, with no discernible signs of acute fractures or dislocations within the visualized bony structures.
