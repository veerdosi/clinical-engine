The X-ray depicts the right humerus, demonstrating a potential fracture located in the mid-shaft region. There is notable cortical disruption and possible displacement of the fragment, indicating a closed fracture with concerns for soft tissue involvement. Additionally, the alignment of surrounding anatomical structures suggests the potential for associated soft tissue swelling or hematoma formation.
