The X-ray image displays a notable displacement in the humeral head, indicating a possible fracture or dislocation. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joint, suggestive of an inflammatory response or hematoma formation. Additionally, the acromion appears intact, but there may be underlying pathological changes in the glenohumeral joint that require further evaluation.
