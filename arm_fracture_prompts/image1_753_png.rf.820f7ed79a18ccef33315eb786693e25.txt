The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, highlighting the alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an observable angular deformity at the region of the distal humerus, suggestive of a fracture malunion or possibly a deformity such as cubitus varus or valgus. Additionally, the presence of hardware, likely an intramedullary nail or plate, indicates prior surgical intervention, possibly due to a previous fracture in this area.
