The X-ray image demonstrates the left elbow joint, highlighting the presence of a metallic screw which suggests prior surgical intervention, likely for fracture fixation or reconstruction. The alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna appears satisfactory, with no visible signs of acute fracture or dislocation in the immediate vicinity of the implant. Additionally, cortical bone integrity is preserved, but the image may warrant further evaluation for signs of surrounding soft tissue edema or potential infection, given the presence of the hardware.
