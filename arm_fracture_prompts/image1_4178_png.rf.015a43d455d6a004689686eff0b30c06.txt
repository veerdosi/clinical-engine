The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of a hand in an open palm orientation, focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a noticeable angulation and possible displacement of the middle phalanx, suggesting a potential fracture or malalignment indicative of a Boxer's fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the involved area, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
