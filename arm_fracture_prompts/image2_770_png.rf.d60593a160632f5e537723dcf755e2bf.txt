The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint, demonstrating a notable angular deformity consistent with a cubitus varus, commonly referred to as "gunstock deformity." There is evidence of joint effusion, as indicated by the increased radiolucency around the olecranon and surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, the articulation surfaces of the humerus and ulna appear irregular, suggesting possible underlying osteochondral injury or degeneration.
