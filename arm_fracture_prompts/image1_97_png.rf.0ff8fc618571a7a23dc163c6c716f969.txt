The X-ray image reveals a right forearm with a noticeable fracture at the mid-shaft of the radius and ulna, characterized by a clear discontinuity in the cortical bone. There is also evidence of angular deformity and possible malalignment of the distal segments, which may indicate a displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site is observed, which may suggest associated contusion or edema.
