The image depicts an X-ray of the elbow joint, showing distinct elements of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there appears to be an irregularity at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, which may suggest the presence of an olecranon bursitis or lateral epicondylitis. Additionally, joint space narrowing can be observed, indicating potential degenerative changes or inflammatory processes such as arthritis in the elbow region.
