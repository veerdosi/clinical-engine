The X-ray reveals an abnormal angulation of the distal humerus, suggestive of a deformity in the elbow region. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture through the medial condyle, which may indicate underlying trauma or stress to the osseous structure. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed adjacent to the joint, potentially indicating an inflammatory process or hematoma formation.
