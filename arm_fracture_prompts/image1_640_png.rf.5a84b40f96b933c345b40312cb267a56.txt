The X-ray image demonstrates the left hand, specifically highlighting the phalangeal structures of the fingers. There is observable joint space narrowing in the interphalangeal joints, suggesting potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appear to be sclerotic changes at the distal ends of the phalanges, indicating increased bone density that may be associated with chronic inflammatory processes.
