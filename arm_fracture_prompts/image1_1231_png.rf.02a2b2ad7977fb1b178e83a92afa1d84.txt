The radiograph presents a right forearm in a posteroanterior (PA) view, demonstrating the alignment and integrity of both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an observable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a transverse line and associated soft tissue swelling, indicating potential periosteal reaction. The proximal carpal region exhibits normal joint alignment and bone density, with no signs of osteolytic lesions or significant degenerative changes evident in the available image.
