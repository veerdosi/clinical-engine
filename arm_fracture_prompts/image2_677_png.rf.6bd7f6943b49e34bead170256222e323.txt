The X-ray image displays an anatomic view of the right hand, where a noticeable deformity is present in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the affected digit. There is evidence of digit flexion deformity, indicative of a possible mallet finger or drooping of the distal phalanx due to disruption of the extensor tendon mechanism. Additionally, joint alignment may be compromised, suggesting potential underlying pathologies such as arthritis or joint dislocation.
