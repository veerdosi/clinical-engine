The X-ray image displays the left forearm, revealing a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disrupted cortical outline. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicative of a potential hematoma formation. The alignment of the distal ulnar and proximal carpals appears preserved, with no apparent signs of dislocation or significant angular deformity.
