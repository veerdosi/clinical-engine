The X-ray image presented shows the left humerus, which appears to demonstrate a notable cortical irregularity along the mid-shaft region. There is evidence of periosteal reaction, suggesting potential underlying pathology, such as a benign or malignant lesion. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue structures exhibit signs of edematous changes, indicative of possible inflammatory processes.
