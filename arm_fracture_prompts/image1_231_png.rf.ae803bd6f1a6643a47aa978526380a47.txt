The X-ray reveals an osseous structure indicative of a potential effusion surrounding the knee joint, characterized by increased joint space. Notably, there is an observed osteophyte formation along the margins of the femoral condyles, suggestive of osteoarthritis. The articulating surfaces exhibit irregularity, indicating possible subchondral bone changes consistent with degenerative joint disease.
