The image presents a left wrist radiograph displaying an intramedullary fixation device, suggesting previous surgical intervention for a fracture. There is evidence of a healed diaphyseal fracture of the distal radius, indicated by callous formation surrounding the fracture site. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, although there may be signs of potential post-traumatic arthritis due to prior injury.
