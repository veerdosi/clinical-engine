The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the proximal phalanx and distal phalanx of the middle finger. There is evidence of apparent deformity characterized by joint misalignment at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which may suggest possible arthritis or previous trauma. Additionally, there is a notable increase in bone density surrounding the distal phalanx, which could indicate chronic changes associated with osteomyelitis or other inflammatory processes.
