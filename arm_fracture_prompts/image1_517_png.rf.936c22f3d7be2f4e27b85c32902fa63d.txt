The image depicts an X-ray of the elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna bones clearly. Notable joint space narrowing is observed, which may suggest the presence of arthritic changes in the elbow joint. There is also a slight irregularity in the articular surface, which could indicate localized degeneration or potential osteophyte formation.
