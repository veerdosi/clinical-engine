The X-ray image depicts a left hand with notable findings in the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit. There is evidence of a fracture with malalignment, characterized by displacement and angulation, indicating a potential fracture-dislocation at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be observed, suggesting the body's healing response to the fracture.
