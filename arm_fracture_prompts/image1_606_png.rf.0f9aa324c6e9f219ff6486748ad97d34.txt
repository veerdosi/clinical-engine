The X-ray image depicts a left shoulder joint with notable abnormalities in the humeral head and glenoid cavity. There is evidence of a possible rotator cuff pathology, as suggested by changes in the contour of the humeral head and surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, there may be signs indicative of degenerative joint disease, characterized by decreased joint space and subchondral sclerosis in the glenoid region.
