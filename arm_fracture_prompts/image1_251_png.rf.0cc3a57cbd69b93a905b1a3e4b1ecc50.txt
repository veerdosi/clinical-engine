The radiograph presents a right hand, where the anatomical structures of the metacarpals and phalanges are visible. There is notable evidence of articular surface irregularity, suggestive of osteoarthritis, as indicated by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis around affected joints. Additionally, there may be periosteal reactions observed, which can indicate underlying inflammatory or degenerative processes affecting the bone marrow or joint space.
