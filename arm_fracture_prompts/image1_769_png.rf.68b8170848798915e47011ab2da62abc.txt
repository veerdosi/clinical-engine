The X-ray demonstrates a left arm with notable angular deformity at the elbow joint, suggestive of a possible cubitus varus or "gunstock deformity." There is evidence of asymmetric cortical bone thickening and potential joint effusion in the surrounding area, indicating possible post-traumatic changes or chronic stress. Additionally, the alignment of the radial and ulnar bones suggests potential malunion or instability at the site of the elbow, warranting further evaluation for any associated injuries or pathologies.
