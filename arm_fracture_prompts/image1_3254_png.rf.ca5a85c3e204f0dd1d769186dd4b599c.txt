The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left hand, prominently showing the phalangeal bones of the fingers. Notably, a radiopaque foreign object is observed within the soft tissue of the hand, indicating potential foreign body insertion or trauma. There are no evident fractures or dislocations within the bony structure; however, surrounding soft tissue edema may be suggested due to the presence of the foreign object.
