The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the distal femur, revealing the presence of an intramedullary nail and accompanying screws. There is evidence of a previous surgical intervention to stabilize a femoral fracture, indicated by the hardware in situ. Additionally, the cortical bone exhibits signs of potential bone remodeling or callus formation surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest a healing process.
