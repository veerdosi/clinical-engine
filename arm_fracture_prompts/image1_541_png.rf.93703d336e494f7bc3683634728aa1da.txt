The X-ray image displays the distal phalanx of the thumb in an oblique projection, revealing significant deformation characterized by angulation and possible cortical disruption. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the phalanx, which may indicate an underlying acute injury such as a fracture or a soft tissue strain. Additionally, signs suggestive of joint effusion at the metacarpophalangeal joint may be noted, implying potential inflammatory processes or trauma to the surrounding structures.
