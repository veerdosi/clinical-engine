The image displays an anteroposterior (AP) radiographic view of the left forearm, including the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of cortical irregularity along the radius, which may indicate a fracture or bone pathology such as osteomyelitis. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears intact, but any abnormalities in surrounding soft tissue structures cannot be assessed from this radiograph alone.
