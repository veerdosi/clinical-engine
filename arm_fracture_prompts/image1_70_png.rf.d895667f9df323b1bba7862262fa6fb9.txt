The X-ray image of the left elbow reveals an abnormal joint alignment, indicating a possible valgus deformity at the ulnohumeral articulation. There is notable joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation around the medial compartment, suggestive of degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis in the distal humerus and proximal ulna may indicate chronic mechanical stress or joint degeneration.
