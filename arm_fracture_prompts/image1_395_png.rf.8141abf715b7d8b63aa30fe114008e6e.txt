The provided X-ray image displays the left wrist and hand, with particular attention to the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a notable presence of an intra-articular fracture at the distal end of the radius, evident by the displacement and malalignment observed in the radiographic view. Additionally, joint effusion may be suspected due to the irregularity and increased radiolucency around the wrist joint, indicating potential associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory processes.
