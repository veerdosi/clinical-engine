The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the diaphysis of the radius with associated cortical disruption. Notably, the fracture lines exhibit significant displacement, indicating instability in the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture, which may suggest a possible hematoma formation.
