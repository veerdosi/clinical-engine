The X-ray image reveals a significant mid-diaphyseal fracture of the left radius, characterized by a displaced fracture line. Additionally, there is evidence of an intramedullary fixation device, indicative of prior surgical intervention for stabilization. Surrounding soft tissue shows no acute effusion, but there may be subtle signs of periosteal reaction consistent with a recent injury.
