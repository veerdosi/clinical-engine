The provided X-ray image displays the left wrist, revealing an altered alignment of the distal radius and ulna, which is suggestive of potential malalignment. There is notable cortical disruption and soft tissue swelling around the distal radius, indicating possible fracture or other traumatic injury. Additionally, joint effusion is suggested by the increased radiolucency around the wrist joint, which may be associated with inflammatory processes or intra-articular injury.
