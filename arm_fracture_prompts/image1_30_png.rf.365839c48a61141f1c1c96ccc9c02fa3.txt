The X-ray image demonstrates a right forearm with clear visualization of both the radius and ulna. There is an observable area of cortical disruption suggestive of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a complete break. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be indicated around the fracture site, which could suggest contusion or edema associated with the injury.
