The image depicts a left shoulder X-ray, revealing a metallic implant positioned in the proximal humerus, indicative of a possible surgical intervention such as arthroplasty or fixation of a fracture. There is a notable presence of bone deformity around the surgical site, raising the suspicion of post-operative alterations, such as osteolysis or malalignment. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear intact, with no evident signs of acute edema or calcification, further highlighting the structural changes in the context of previous orthopedic management.
