The image shows an X-ray of the right elbow joint, revealing the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. There is a significant pathology observed in the form of a large osteochondroma originating from the posterior aspect of the distal humerus, exhibiting a well-defined cortex and an intact medullary canal. Additionally, signs of adjacent soft tissue swelling may suggest a reactive process, though no acute fractures are evident in the bony structures.
