The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by a distinct disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is notable soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating potential hematoma formation. The alignment of the bone fragments is significantly altered, displaying angulation that may affect joint function and necessitate proper evaluation for potential complications.
