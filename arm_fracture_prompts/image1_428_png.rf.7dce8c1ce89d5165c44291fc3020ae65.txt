The X-ray of the left wrist demonstrates multiple osseous structures, including the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a visible distortion of the carpal alignment, which may suggest the presence of a scaphoid fracture or ligamentous injury, as indicated by the discontinuity in the carpal outlines. Additionally, the cortical bone integrity appears compromised in the region of interest, with signs of potential avascular necrosis or osteitis evident in adjacent areas.
