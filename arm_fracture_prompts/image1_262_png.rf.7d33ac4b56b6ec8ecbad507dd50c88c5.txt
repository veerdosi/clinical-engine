The image presents a lateral X-ray view of the right wrist, revealing significant deformities around the distal radius and ulnar bones. There is evident angulation of the distal radius, suggesting a possible fracture or malalignment, which may indicate a history of trauma or an underlying disease process. Additionally, the carpal bones exhibit a misalignment, possibly pointing toward post-traumatic changes or conditions such as arthritis affecting joint integrity and positioning.
