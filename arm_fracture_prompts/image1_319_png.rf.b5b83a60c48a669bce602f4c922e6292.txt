The X-ray image of the left wrist displays a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical outline and a notable angulation at the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of a comminuted fracture pattern involving the distal end of the radius, which raises concern for associated soft tissue injury. No significant signs of osteopenia or tumors are evident; however, the alignment of the carpal bones should be evaluated for potential dislocation or subluxation.
