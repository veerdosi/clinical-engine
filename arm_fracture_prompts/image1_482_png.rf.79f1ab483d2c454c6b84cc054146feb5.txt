The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the elbow joint, highlighting the humeroulnar and humeroradial articulations. Notable findings include the presence of osteophytes at the margins of the olecranon, suggestive of osteoarthritis, as well as joint space narrowing, indicative of degenerative changes. Additionally, there may be signs of effusion in the joint capsule, as evidenced by a potential fluid collection at the recesses surrounding the joint, which could be associated with inflammatory or traumatic conditions.
