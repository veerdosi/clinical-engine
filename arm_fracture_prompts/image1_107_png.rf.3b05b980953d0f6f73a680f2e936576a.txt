The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the elbow joint, demonstrating the presence of metallic hardware consistent with internal fixation devices utilized in the surgical management of fractures. Notable is the displacement of the ulnar and radial structures, indicative of a complex fracture pattern that may involve comminuted segments. The surrounding soft tissue structures appear normal, with no evidence of acute joint effusion or bony deformity beyond the surgical intervention.
