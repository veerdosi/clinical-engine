The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Notably, there appears to be a deformity characterized by abnormal alignment of the olecranon and altered contours of the joint surfaces, suggesting a possible joint effusion or underlying fracture. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema, indicative of inflammation or trauma affecting the elbow region.
