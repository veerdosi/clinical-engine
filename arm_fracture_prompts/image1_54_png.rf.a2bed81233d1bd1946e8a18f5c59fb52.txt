The X-ray image of the right hand reveals a clear view of the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. There is an observable misalignment at the distal aspect of the metacarpal bones, suggestive of a potential fracture or dislocation. Additionally, the joint spaces appear well-defined, with no signs of significant degenerative changes or osteoarthritis noted in the visible structures.
