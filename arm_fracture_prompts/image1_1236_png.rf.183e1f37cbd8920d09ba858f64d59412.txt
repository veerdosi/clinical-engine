The X-ray image demonstrates an arthroplasty or fixation device within the left elbow joint, indicated by the presence of a metallic plate and screws. A possible post-traumatic change or previous fracture is evident, as suggested by the alignment of the anatomical structures surrounding the implant. Additionally, the articulation of the humeroulnar joint appears to exhibit mild degenerative changes, potentially signaling post-operative alterations in joint mechanics.
