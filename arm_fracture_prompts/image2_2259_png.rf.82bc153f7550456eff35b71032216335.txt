The X-ray demonstrates the left shoulder girdle with a focus on the proximal humerus and the glenohumeral joint. Notable is the presence of an osseous irregularity at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may indicate a possible rotator cuff tear or avulsion fracture. Additionally, there is a mild acromioclavicular joint separation evident in the lateral projection, suggesting potential instability or trauma to the shoulder complex.
