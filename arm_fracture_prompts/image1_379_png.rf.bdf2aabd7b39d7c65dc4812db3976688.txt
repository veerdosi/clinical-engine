The X-ray image depicts the left hand in a standard lateral view, focusing on the phalangeal bones. Notable findings include an angulated fracture of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and displacement. Additionally, there may be associated soft tissue swelling, which is commonly observed in acute fracture scenarios.
