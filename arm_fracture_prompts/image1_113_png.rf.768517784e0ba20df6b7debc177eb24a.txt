The X-ray images depict the left forearm, including the radius and ulna, clearly showing alignment and bony integrity. Notably, there is an indication of a fracture through the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by displacement and potential angulation of the bony fragments. Additionally, the joint spaces at the elbow and wrist appear unremarkable, suggesting no acute dislocation or significant joint effusion present.
