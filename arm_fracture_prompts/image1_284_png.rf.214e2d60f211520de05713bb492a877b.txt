The X-ray image presents the right shoulder, showcasing the bony structures of the scapula, humerus, and clavicle. Notable findings include the potential presence of an acromioclavicular joint separation or subacromial impingement, indicated by the alignment and spacing between these structures. Additionally, any signs of osteophyte formation or joint space narrowing may suggest underlying degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis in the glenohumeral joint region.
