The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the humeral region, revealing a significant abnormality characterized by an evident humeral head deformity. There is indicated subluxation of the shoulder joint, with alignment issues between the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Additionally, the presence of soft tissue swelling around the glenohumeral joint suggests potential inflammatory pathology, which may warrant further investigation for conditions such as rotator cuff pathology or possible impingement syndrome.
