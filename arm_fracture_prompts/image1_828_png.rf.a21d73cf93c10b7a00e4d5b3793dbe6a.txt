The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the humerus, showing the presence of an intramedullary rod stabilizing a midshaft fracture. Evidence of callus formation is noted, indicating the healing process following surgical intervention. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable with no signs of acute osseous complications or gross deformity associated with the fracture.
