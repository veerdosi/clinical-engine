The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, revealing the anatomical structures of the humerus and scapula. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by potential subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation at the humeral head. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joint may indicate an inflammatory process, which could be associated with conditions such as bursitis or tendinitis affecting the rotator cuff region.
