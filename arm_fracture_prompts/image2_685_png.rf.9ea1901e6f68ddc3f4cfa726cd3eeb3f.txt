The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the left forearm, illustrating the ulna and radius. There is a notable presence of a metallic artifact, likely indicating the presence of an intramedullary nail or fixation device, which suggests a history of surgical intervention. Additionally, the cortex of the ulna appears to exhibit irregularity, raising suspicion for potential complications such as nonunion or malunion at the fracture site.
