The X-ray image depicts the right knee joint, showcasing the femur and tibia with clear visualization of the joint space. Notably, there is an abnormal prominence of the medial femoral condyle suggestive of a possible osteochondral lesion or a bone cyst formation. The soft tissue structures surrounding the knee appear intact, but further evaluation may be warranted to assess for potential underlying pathologies such as chondromalacia or degenerative joint disease.
