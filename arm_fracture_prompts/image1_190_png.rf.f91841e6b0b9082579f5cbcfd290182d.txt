The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right shoulder joint, highlighting significant osteophyte formation at the glenohumeral joint, indicative of osteoarthritis. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, alongside sclerosis of the subchondral bone, which are common radiological findings associated with degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the presence of bony abnormalities around the acromion suggests possible impingement, warranting further clinical evaluation.
