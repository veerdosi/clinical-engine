The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the right hand, revealing several bony structures including the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. There is an apparent misalignment noted in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger, which may suggest a possible joint dislocation or subluxation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling appears adjacent to the affected joint, indicating the potential presence of an inflammatory process or trauma.
