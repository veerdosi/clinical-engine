The image depicts a lateral X-ray view of the left hand, specifically highlighting the proximal phalanx and distal phalanx of the index finger. There is evidence of a potential fracture or abnormal alignment observed in the distal phalanx, which may indicate a compromise to the integrity of the phalanx. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear normal without signs of significant swelling or effusion, suggesting limited acute inflammatory response.
