The X-ray image depicts the left hand, with clear visualization of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture involving the proximal phalanx of the middle finger, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone and possible displacement. Additionally, there is surrounding soft tissue swelling which may suggest an acute injury or inflammatory process in the region.
