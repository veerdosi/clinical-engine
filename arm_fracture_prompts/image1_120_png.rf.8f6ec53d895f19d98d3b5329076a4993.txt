The provided image is a radiograph of the left hand, displaying the carpal and phalangeal bones. There is notable evidence of joint space narrowing between the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may suggest an underlying arthropathy. Additionally, the presence of marginal osteophytes on the proximal interphalangeal joints indicates possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
