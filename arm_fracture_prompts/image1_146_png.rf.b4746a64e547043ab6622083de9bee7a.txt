The X-ray shows a lateral view of the left hand, highlighting possible fractures in the phalanges of the index finger, particularly in the proximal phalanx. Notably, the image reveals the presence of metallic fixation device, indicating prior surgical intervention for the management of a fracture. The alignment of the bony structures appears compromised, suggesting a potential malunion or nonunion at the fracture site.
