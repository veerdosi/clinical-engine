The image displays a right forearm radiograph, showing the radius and ulna in a typical anatomical alignment. Notably, there is an apparent fracture present in the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and potential displacement of the fracture fragments. In addition, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggesting an acute injury.
