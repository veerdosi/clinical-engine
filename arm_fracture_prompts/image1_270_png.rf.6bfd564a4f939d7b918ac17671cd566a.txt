The image depicts an anteroposterior (AP) X-ray of the right shoulder joint, illustrating the humeral head articulating with the glenoid fossa. Notable is the presence of degenerative changes, including potential osteoarthritis indicated by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis around the glenoid. Additionally, there may be evidence of a possible rotator cuff tear or impingement due to the observed displacement of the humeral head or irregularities in the greater tuberosity region.
