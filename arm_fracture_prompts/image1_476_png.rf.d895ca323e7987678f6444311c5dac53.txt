The X-ray image displays the right humerus and elbow joint, showcasing an apparent misalignment at the lateral condyle, indicative of a potential fracture or dislocation. The joint space appears widened, which may suggest effusion, while the surrounding soft tissues demonstrate signs of edema. Additionally, there is evidence of cortical disruption in the distal humerus, raising the suspicion of acute trauma or underlying pathology such as a stress fracture.
