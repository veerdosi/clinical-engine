The image depicts an oblique X-ray of a human hand, with particular focus on the phalanges of the index finger. There is a visible angulation and displacement at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggestive of a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted surrounding the affected area, which may indicate an inflammatory response associated with an acute injury.
