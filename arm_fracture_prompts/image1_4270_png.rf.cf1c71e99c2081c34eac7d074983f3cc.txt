The X-ray image displays the lateral view of a hand, revealing the skeletal structure of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, the image indicates a possible fracture at the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, as evidenced by the displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, which may suggest an accompanying hematoma or injury-related edema.
