The radiograph presents a medial view of the knee joint, highlighting the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella. There is a notable joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis affecting the knee, characterized by degenerative changes. Additional assessment reveals potential effusion in the suprapatellar recess, indicative of possible inflammatory or degenerative pathology affecting the joint.
