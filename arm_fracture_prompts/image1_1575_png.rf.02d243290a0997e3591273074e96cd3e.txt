The X-ray image reveals an abnormal alignment of the distal radius, indicating a possible fracture in the wrist region. There appears to be internal fixation hardware present, suggesting that an operative intervention has been performed to stabilize the fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may indicate a post-traumatic response.
