The X-ray image depicts the right hand, specifically focusing on the metacarpal and phalangeal regions. There is an observable deformity characterized by a significant angular deviation at the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggesting the possibility of a malalignment or subluxation. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joints, which may indicate an inflammatory process or potential underlying infectious etiology.
