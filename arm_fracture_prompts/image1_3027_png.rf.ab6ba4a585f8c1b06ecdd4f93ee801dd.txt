The X-ray image presents a clear view of the left wrist, demonstrating the carpal bones and proximal metacarpals. There is a notable presence of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, which may suggest inflammatory or traumatic pathology. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears intact, with no apparent fractures or acute bony lesions observed in the visualized structures.
