The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the knee joint, highlighting the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula. There appears to be an irregularity in the joint space, potentially indicative of joint effusion or arthritic changes, which may suggest underlying osteoarthritis or synovitis. Additionally, the presence of any bony spurs or osteophytes along the joint margins could further support the diagnosis of degenerative joint disease.
