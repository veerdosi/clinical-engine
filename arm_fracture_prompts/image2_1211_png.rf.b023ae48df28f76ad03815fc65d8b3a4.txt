The image depicts an X-ray of the right humerus, demonstrating a mid-shaft fracture characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone. There is evidence of internal fixation, indicated by the presence of surgical hardware, likely screws or plates, suggesting prior orthopedic intervention. Additionally, the alignment of the fracture fragments appears to be maintained, with no signs of malunion or nonunion visible within this projection.
