The X-ray image depicts the left upper limb, focusing on the humerus, elbow joint, and proximal radius and ulna. There is apparent cortical disruption at the mid-shaft of the humerus indicative of a possible diaphyseal fracture, characterized by an angulated and displaced configuration. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site shows evidence of swelling, which may suggest associated soft tissue injury or hematoma formation.
