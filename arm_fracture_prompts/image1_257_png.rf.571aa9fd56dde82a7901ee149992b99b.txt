The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left shoulder, demonstrating the anatomical structures of the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is a discernible presence of acromioclavicular joint space narrowing, which may be indicative of degenerative joint disease, commonly known as osteoarthritis. Additionally, subtle cortical irregularities in the region of the greater tuberosity of the humerus suggest possible rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
