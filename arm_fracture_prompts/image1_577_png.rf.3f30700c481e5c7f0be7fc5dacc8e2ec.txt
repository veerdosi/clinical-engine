The X-ray image demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the left upper extremity, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable in the image is a significant angulation of the distal humerus indicating a possible fracture or deformity in the area. There is also evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, which may suggest acute inflammation or injury associated with the underlying osseous structures.
