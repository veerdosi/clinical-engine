The X-ray demonstrates an elbow joint with evidence of a fracture involving the distal humerus and the proximal ulna, indicated by the disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. There is also the presence of internal fixation hardware, suggesting that a surgical intervention was performed to stabilize the fracture and promote healing. Additionally, there are signs of possible joint effusion, observed through the radiolucent area around the elbow joint, indicating a potential inflammatory process or trauma related to the fracture.
