The X-ray image presents a left forearm, demonstrating a notable callus formation indicative of a prior fracture healing. The alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears compromised, suggesting the possibility of malunion or deformity in the bone structure. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction, which may signify underlying osteogenic processes in response to trauma or stress.
