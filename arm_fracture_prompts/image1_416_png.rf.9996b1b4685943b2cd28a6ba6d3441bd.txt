The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the distal phalanges and associated joints. There is notable evidence of a possible deformity in the alignment of the phalanges, indicating potential malunion or misalignment. Additionally, the presence of joint space narrowing may suggest degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis in the involved digits.
