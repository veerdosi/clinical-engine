The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint, highlighting the presence of a metallic plate and screws, indicative of internal fixation. Evidence of an associated fracture can be observed in the distal humerus region, specifically demonstrating a disruption in the continuity of the bony cortex. In addition, signs of callus formation may be noted, suggesting a healing response after surgical intervention for fracture stabilization.
