The X-ray image depicts the left humerus in a lateral view, revealing the presence of a well-defined area of radiolucency indicative of a possible pathological process. Notably, there is a significant deformity characterized by a fracture or malalignment of the diaphysis of the humerus, which may suggest a traumatic injury or underlying pathology. Additionally, the presence of hardware, such as a plate and screws, indicates prior surgical intervention, potentially related to stabilization of the fracture or correction of a deformity.
