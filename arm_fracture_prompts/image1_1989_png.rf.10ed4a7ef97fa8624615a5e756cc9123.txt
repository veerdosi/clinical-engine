The X-ray image demonstrates the left forearm, specifically showing the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a significant angulation at the mid-shaft of the ulna, suggestive of a potential fracture. Soft tissue swelling is not clearly delineated, but any abnormal periosteal reaction or callus formation would require further evaluation for healing processes if present.
