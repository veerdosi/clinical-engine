The X-ray image shows the distal radius and ulna in the wrist, displaying normal alignment and osseous structures. If present, any signs of post-traumatic changes or fractures should be noted, including the presence of non-union or malunion. Additionally, joint spaces appear preserved; however, any evidence of osteochondral defects or signs of degenerative joint disease would be relevant in further evaluation.
