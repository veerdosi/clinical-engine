The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the left hand, particularly highlighting the metacarpals and phalanges of the fingers. There is notable angulation in the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggestive of possible digit misalignment or deformity. No acute fractures are evident; however, the joint spaces appear irregular, which may indicate early signs of osteoarthritis or other distal joint pathology.
