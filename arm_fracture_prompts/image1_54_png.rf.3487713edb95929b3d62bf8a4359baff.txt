The radiograph displays the forearm, including the distal humerus, ulna, and radius in an anteroposterior and lateral view. Notably, there is evidence of a diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete break with angulation visible in the alignment of the bone. Additionally, the ulna appears intact, while there may be associated soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, indicative of potential hematoma formation.
