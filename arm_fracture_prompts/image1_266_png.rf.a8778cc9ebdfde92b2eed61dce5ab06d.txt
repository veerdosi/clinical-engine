The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit (little finger) on the left hand. Findings indicate possible displacement at the fracture site, as evidenced by a misalignment of the bone cortices. There is also surrounding soft tissue swelling that may suggest a concomitant soft tissue injury.
