The X-ray image presents the right wrist, revealing the radiographic anatomy of the carpal bones, distal radius, and distal ulna. There is evidence of a possible fracture or malalignment in the distal radius, indicated by an abnormal discontinuity in the cortex and changes in the trabecular pattern. Additionally, there is an abnormal radiolucency around the wrist joint, suggesting the presence of a potential soft tissue injury or joint effusion.
