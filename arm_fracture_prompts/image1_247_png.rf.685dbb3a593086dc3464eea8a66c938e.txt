The X-ray image displays a right forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna with clear visibility of the wrist joint. There is no evidence of significant bone displacement; however, subtle cortical irregularities can be observed in the distal radius, suggesting a possible fracture or stress injury. Soft tissue swelling is indicated around the wrist joint, which may correlate with underlying inflammatory or traumatic processes affecting the surrounding structures.
