The X-ray image reveals a right forearm exhibiting an intramedullary nail fixation, indicating a previous surgical intervention for a fracture stabilization. There is evidence of the healing process within the radial and ulnar bones, with some potential callus formation visible at the fracture site. Furthermore, the presence of metallic hardware is noted, suggesting a fixation method employed to maintain alignment during bone healing.
