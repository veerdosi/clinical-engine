The X-ray image displays an anterior-posterior view of the left shoulder, demonstrating the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is a notable irregularity in the humeral head, suggestive of a potential osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis, characterized by subchondral sclerosis and possible cyst formation. Additionally, soft tissue shadows indicate possible associated soft tissue edema, which may reflect an inflammatory process such as bursitis or tendinopathy in the region of the rotator cuff.
