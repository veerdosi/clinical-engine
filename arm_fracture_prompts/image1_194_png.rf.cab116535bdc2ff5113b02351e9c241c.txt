The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right elbow joint, revealing the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an observable joint effusion suggestive of intra-articular pathology, characterized by the distension of the joint space. Additionally, there are signs of potential osteophyte formation around the olecranon, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis in the elbow joint.
