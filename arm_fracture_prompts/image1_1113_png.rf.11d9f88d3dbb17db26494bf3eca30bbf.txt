The X-ray image displayed shows the phalanges of the left hand, with particular attention to the alignment and integrity of the bones. Notable changes in cortical bone density may suggest potential osteopenia or a fracture in the proximal phalanges, which requires further evaluation. Additionally, the visualization of joint spaces indicates possible signs of degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis, characterized by loss of joint cartilage and changes in subchondral bone density.
