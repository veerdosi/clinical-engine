The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left distal femur and proximal tibia, highlighting the knee joint. Notably, there is an abnormality characterized by an apparent joint effusion within the suprapatellar bursa, suggesting potential underlying pathologies such as inflammatory arthritis or trauma. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes at the joint margins may indicate the development of osteoarthritis, reflecting degenerative changes in the articular surfaces.
