The X-ray image of the left forearm demonstrates a clear visualization of both the radius and ulna, showcasing their anatomical alignment. There is a notable cortical discontinuity along the mid-shaft of the radius, indicative of a potential fracture, which may suggest acute trauma to the area. Additionally, the joint spaces appear preserved, with no evident signs of degenerative changes or significant soft tissue swelling surrounding the bones.
