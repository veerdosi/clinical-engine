The X-ray image displays a right knee joint with noticeable soft tissue swelling adjacent to the femoral condyle. There is a distinct well-defined osteochondroma observed at the margin of the femur, characterized by a cortex that is continuous with the underlying bone structure. Additionally, joint alignment appears preserved; however, there may be signs of irritation within the surrounding soft tissues indicative of localized inflammation.
