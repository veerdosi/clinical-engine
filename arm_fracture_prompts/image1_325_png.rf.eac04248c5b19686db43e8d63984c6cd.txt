The image depicts a lateral view X-ray of the forearm, showcasing both the radius and ulna. There is a visible angulation and distraction at the mid-shaft of the ulna, suggesting the presence of a fracture, potentially a midshaft fracture. Additionally, there is an apparent alignment irregularity of the radius, indicating a concomitant injury, which may compromise the overall stability of the forearm structure.
