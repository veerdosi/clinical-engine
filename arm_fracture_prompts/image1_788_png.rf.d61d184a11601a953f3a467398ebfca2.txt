The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the right hand, highlighting the phalangeal bones of the fifth digit (little finger). There is a noticeable angulation at the distal interphalangeal joint, suggesting a potential phalanx fracture or dislocation. No significant joint effusion is observed in the surrounding soft tissues, and the overall bony alignment appears compromised, indicating a possible injury or deformity affecting the functionality of the digit.
