The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the right hand, with a prominent metallic foreign body appearing in the soft tissue adjacent to the phalanges. There is evidence of space-occupying lesions in the surrounding soft tissues, which may indicate the presence of a localized inflammatory process or foreign body reaction. Additionally, the joint spaces, particularly at the metacarpophalangeal joints, appear within normal limits with no acute fractures or dislocations observed in the bony structures.
