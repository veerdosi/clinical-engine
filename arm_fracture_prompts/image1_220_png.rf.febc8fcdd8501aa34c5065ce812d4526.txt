The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint in a flexed position, revealing both the humerus and the radius as the primary bones involved. Notably, there is an abnormal alignment of the ulna, indicating a potential malalignment or misalignment that may suggest a deformity. Joint spaces appear narrowed, which may indicate degenerative changes or potential inflammatory processes related to conditions such as osteoarthritis.
