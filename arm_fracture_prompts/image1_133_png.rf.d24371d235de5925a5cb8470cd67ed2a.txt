The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right humerus, highlighting a notable angular deformity in the midshaft region, suggestive of a potential malunion or fracture healing with abnormal alignment. There is evidence of cortical thinning and irregularity, which may indicate underlying bone pathology, such as osteopenia or previous trauma. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is appreciated surrounding the elbow joint, which could further signify an inflammatory process or trauma adjacent to the bony structures.
