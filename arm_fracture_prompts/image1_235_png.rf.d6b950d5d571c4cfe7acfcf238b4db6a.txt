The image depicts a lateral view of the left fifth digit, highlighting the phalangeal bones and the metacarpophalangeal joint. Notable is the presence of a possible malalignment or deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicating a potential dislocation or subluxation. The joint spaces appear narrowed, which may suggest degenerative changes or inflammatory conditions affecting the digital articulations.
