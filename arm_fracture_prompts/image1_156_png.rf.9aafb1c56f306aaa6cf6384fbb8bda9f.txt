The X-ray image presents an oblique view of the forearm, showing the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a cortical disruption and associated periosteal reaction. Additionally, mild displacement at the fracture site is noted, indicating the potential for instability in the surrounding soft tissues.
