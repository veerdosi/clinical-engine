The X-ray image demonstrates the elbow joint in a lateral view, highlighting the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is notable joint space narrowing at the humeroulnar articulation, which may indicate potential osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, a small osteophyte formation may be observed at the margins of the joint surfaces, suggesting chronic joint instability or irritation.
