The provided X-ray image shows a lateral view of the proximal humerus, revealing possible signs of avulsion fracture at the insertion point of the rotator cuff. There appears to be an irregularity in the cortical bone that may suggest the presence of bone marrow edema associated with underlying osteopathic changes. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observed, which can be indicative of underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease.
