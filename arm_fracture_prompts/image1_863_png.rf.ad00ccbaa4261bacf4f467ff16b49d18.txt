The X-ray image reveals an abnormality in the right knee joint, notably at the distal femur and proximal tibia. There is evidence of joint effusion, characterized by increased radiolucency around the region, which may suggest an inflammatory process such as synovitis or possible intra-articular pathology. Additionally, the alignment of the knee joint appears compromised, indicating potential signs of osteoarthritis or a previous traumatic injury, such as a fracture.
