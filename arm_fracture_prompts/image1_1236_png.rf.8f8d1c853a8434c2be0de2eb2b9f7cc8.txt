The radiograph depicts the left elbow joint, showcasing a metallic fixation device, likely indicative of previous surgical intervention for a fracture. Notable in the image is the presence of a screw, which suggests stabilization of the bone structure, potentially due to an operative procedure following a fracture or an osteotomy. Additionally, the surrounding bone appears to exhibit no significant signs of acute deformity or pathological changes, although the presence of the hardware is suggestive of prior orthopedic management.
