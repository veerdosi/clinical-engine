The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx in the fifth digit of the left hand, characterized by a misalignment at the fracture site. An internal fixation device is present, indicating surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture and promote proper healing. Surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema, which is commonly observed in acute fracture scenarios.
