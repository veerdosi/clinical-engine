The X-ray presented depicts the left elbow joint, showing a possible posterolateral displacement of the radial head. There is an apparent lucency in the proximal ulna and humerus, which may suggest either a fracture or an abnormal bony morphology. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present, indicating a potential inflammatory process or traumatic injury associated with the elbow joint.
