The image presents an X-ray of the left wrist, where there is evidence of a potential ulnar styloid fracture, indicated by a discontinuity in the cortical bone at the distal ulna. Additionally, there appears to be joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, suggestive of synovitis or inflammatory response. The overall alignment of the carpal bones seems preserved, but attention is warranted regarding the soft tissue shadows that could indicate associated soft tissue pathology.
