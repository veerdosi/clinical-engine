The X-ray image depicts multiple views of a hand, revealing notable bony structures and articulations. Examination indicates the presence of digital bones in various stages of alignment, with significant attention drawn to the first digit, where a pronounced angulation is observed, suggesting a potential deformity such as a malunion or a fracture. Additionally, joint spaces appear to show signs of potential degenerative changes, which may warrant further evaluation for possible pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.
