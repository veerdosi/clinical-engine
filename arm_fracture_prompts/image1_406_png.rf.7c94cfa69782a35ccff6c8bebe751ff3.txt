The X-ray image displays the forearm, including both the radius and ulnar bones, with visible alignment and contour. Notable in this imaging are signs of an acute fracture, characterized by a discontinuity in the bone cortex along the radial shaft. There is also evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, suggesting an inflammatory response typically associated with trauma or injury in the affected region.
