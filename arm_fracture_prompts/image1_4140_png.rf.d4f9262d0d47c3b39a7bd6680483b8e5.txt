The X-ray image depicts the left hand in an oblique view, revealing the bony structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a visible fracture at the distal phalanx of the finger, characterized by a transverse fracture line and some degree of displacement indicative of a potential fracture pattern. Surrounding soft tissues may show signs of swelling or edema, which can be inferred in the context of trauma or injury to the bone.
