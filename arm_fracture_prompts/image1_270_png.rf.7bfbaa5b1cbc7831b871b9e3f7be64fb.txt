The X-ray image displays the shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and proximal humerus. Notable findings include a pronounced subacromial spur indicative of subacromial impingement syndrome, which may lead to shoulder pain and decreased range of motion. Additionally, there appears to be osteophyte formation along the acromion, suggestive of degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis of the shoulder joint.
