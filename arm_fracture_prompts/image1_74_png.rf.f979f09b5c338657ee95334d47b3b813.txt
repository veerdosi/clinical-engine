The provided X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand and forearm, clearly illustrating the bony structure of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is evidence of a possible malalignment or deformity in the metacarpal region, which may indicate a prior fracture or developmental anomaly. Additionally, joint spaces appear well-defined; however, there are no overt signs of acute inflammatory processes or significant degenerative changes visible within the soft tissues surrounding the bony structures.
