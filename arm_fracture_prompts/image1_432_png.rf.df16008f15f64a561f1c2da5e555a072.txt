The radiograph demonstrates a right humerus in the lateral projection, revealing a noticeable angulation at the midshaft indicative of a possible diaphyseal fracture. There is associated soft tissue swelling suggestive of hematoma formation adjacent to the fracture site. Additional observation reveals potential malalignment, indicating possible rotational deformity of the humeral shaft.
