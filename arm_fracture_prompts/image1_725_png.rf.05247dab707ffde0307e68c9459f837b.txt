The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the phalanges of a finger, demonstrating the presence of surgical hardware indicative of prior fixation. Notably, there is evidence of a comminuted fracture in the distal phalanx, characterized by fragmented bone segments that have been stabilized by pins or screws. The surrounding soft tissues appear intact, with no signs of acute osteomyelitis or other adjacent pathological changes.
