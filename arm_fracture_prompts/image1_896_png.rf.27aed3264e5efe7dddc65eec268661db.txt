The X-ray image displays a left elbow joint with a notable presence of internal fixation devices, including a plate and screws, indicating a previous surgical intervention to stabilize a fracture. The images suggest the presence of a potential nonunion or malunion at the fracture site, characterized by irregular bone alignment and possible callus formation. Additionally, there is evidence of surrounding soft tissue reaction, which may be indicative of inflammation or post-surgical changes associated with the healing process.
