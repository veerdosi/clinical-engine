The X-ray image demonstrates a significant diaphyseal fracture of the ulna, characterized by the presence of a sharp discontinuity in the cortical bone. Associated soft tissue swelling is noted, indicative of surrounding hematoma formation, which suggests an acute traumatic event. Additionally, there appears to be a degree of angulation at the fracture site, which may indicate instability requiring further evaluation for potential surgical intervention.
