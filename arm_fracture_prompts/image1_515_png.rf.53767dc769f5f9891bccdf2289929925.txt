The X-ray image of the right hand displays a clearly defined avulsion fracture at the base of the distal phalanx of the index finger. There is a notable soft tissue swelling around the affected area, suggesting an associated soft tissue injury or hematoma formation. The alignment of the phalanges appears intact, indicating that there are no significant dislocations present in the adjacent joints.
