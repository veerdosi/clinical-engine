The X-ray image reveals a clear fracture of the distal radius and ulna, characterized by a complete disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex. The fracture appears to display angulation and displacement, suggestive of potential instability in the fracture alignment. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction surrounding the fracture site, indicating an inflammatory response to the traumatic event.
