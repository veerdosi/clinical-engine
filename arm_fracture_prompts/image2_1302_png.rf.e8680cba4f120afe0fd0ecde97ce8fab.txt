The X-ray image depicts the forearm, showing both the radius and ulna with a notable abnormality. There is a visible fracture in the distal radius, which is characterized by a cortical breach and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there is a slight angulation of the distal fragment, suggestive of a displaced fracture pattern, which could impact functionality and healing if left untreated.
