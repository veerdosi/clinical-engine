The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, showcasing the osseous structures comprising the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, which may suggest impingement syndrome or the presence of associated rotator cuff pathology. Furthermore, the humeral head appears slightly irregular, potentially indicating osteoarthritis or acute traumatic changes in the glenohumeral joint.
