The X-ray image shows the left hand, specifically illustrating the proximal and distal phalanges of the index and middle fingers. There is evidence of potential osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subarticular sclerosis around the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, slight cortical irregularities in the metacarpals may indicate changes consistent with periosteal reactions or previous trauma.
