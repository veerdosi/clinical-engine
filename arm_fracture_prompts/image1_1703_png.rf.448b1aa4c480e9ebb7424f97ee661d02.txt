The X-ray image displays a left shoulder joint, showing the humeral head and the proximal humerus. A metallic fixation device, likely a plate and screws, is prominently visible, indicating surgical intervention, possibly due to a fracture or instability of the humerus. There is noted cortical disruption suggestive of prior trauma or surgical alteration, with adjacent soft tissue shadowing indicating potential inflammation or edema in the region.
