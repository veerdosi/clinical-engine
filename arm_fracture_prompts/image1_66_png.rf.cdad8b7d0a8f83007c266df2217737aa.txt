The X-ray image presented shows a left forearm, specifically focusing on the radius and ulna. There is an observable radiolucent line indicating a complete fracture through the midshaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and potential displacement of fracture fragments. Additionally, the ulna appears intact, though assessment for any accompanying injuries should not be discounted, particularly in cases of traumatic mechanisms.
