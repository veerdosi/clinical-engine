The X-ray reveals incongruence at the knee joint with signs of possible osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. There is evidence of marginal osteophyte formation around the femoral and tibial condyles, typical of degenerative changes affecting the articular cartilage. Additionally, slight alterations in the bone density adjacent to the joint can suggest underlying bone pathology contributing to impaired function and mobility.
