The image presents a lateral X-ray view of the forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna. There is a visible angulation deformity at the midshaft of the ulnar bone, which may suggest a potential fracture or previous malunion. Additionally, the radiographic appearance indicates possible involvement of the distal radius, which could correlate with a fracture pattern commonly observed in the context of trauma or osteopathy.
