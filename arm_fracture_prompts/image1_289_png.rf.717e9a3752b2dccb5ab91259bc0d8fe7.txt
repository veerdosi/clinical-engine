The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right elbow, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an observable joint effusion in the elbow joint, indicated by increased radiolucency surrounding the joint space, suggestive of potential inflammatory or infectious processes. Additionally, there is a notable appearance of osteophyte formation at the margins of the olecranon process, which may indicate underlying osteoarthritis or degenerative joint changes.
