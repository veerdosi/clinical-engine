The X-ray depicts the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, with emphasis on the elbow joint. There is a notable presence of an abnormal alignment at the elbow, which may indicate a potential dislocation or fracture. The cortical bone appears compromised, with an associated effusion in the surrounding soft tissue compartments, suggestive of possible trauma or inflammatory process.
