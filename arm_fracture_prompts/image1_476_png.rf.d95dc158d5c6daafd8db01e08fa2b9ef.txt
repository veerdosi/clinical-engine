The X-ray image reveals the distal radius and ulna, showcasing the wrist joint in a lateral view. Notably, there is evidence of bone displacement or malalignment, suggestive of a potential fracture in the distal radius, which may compromise the integrity of the carpal bones. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed, indicating possible osteoarthritis or degenerative changes, which could affect the patientâ€™s range of motion and overall wrist function.
