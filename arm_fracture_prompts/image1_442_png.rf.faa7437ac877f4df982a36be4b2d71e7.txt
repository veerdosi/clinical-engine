The image displays an anteroposterior X-ray view of the forearm, including the radius and ulna. Notable in the radiograph is the presence of a prominent radiolucent line through the midshaft of the radius, indicating a potential fracture or cortical disruption. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction along the ulna, suggesting a possible underlying pathology such as stress or trauma-related changes.
