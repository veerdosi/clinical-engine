The X-ray image depicts the left hand in a lateral view, showing the bony structure of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. There are notable anomalies in the alignment of the metacarpophalangeal joints, suggestive of possible osteoarthritic changes or discrepancies in joint spaces. Additionally, the image reveals soft tissue swelling around the distal interphalangeal joints, which may indicate inflammation related to tenosynovitis or synovial fluid accumulation.
