The X-ray image exhibits a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, which may indicate an associated hematoma or inflammatory reaction. The alignment of the radius appears to be compromised, suggesting a possible displacement or angulation of the fracture fragments.
