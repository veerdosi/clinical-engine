The X-ray image of the elbow joint demonstrates a visible fracture of the radial head, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone contour. There is also evidence of possible joint effusion, indicated by the presence of soft tissue swelling around the elbow joint. Additionally, the alignment of the olecranon and the trochlear notch appears altered, suggestive of potential instability or dislocation in the joint mechanism.
