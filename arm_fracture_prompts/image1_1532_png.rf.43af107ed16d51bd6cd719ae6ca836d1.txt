The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the proximal humerus, scapula, and surrounding soft tissues. Notably, there are potential signs of a rotator cuff tear suggested by the irregularity in the greater tuberosity region and blurring of adjacent soft tissues. Additionally, there may be evidence of joint effusion or osteoarthritis inferred from the narrowing of the glenohumeral joint space and possible subchondral sclerosis.
