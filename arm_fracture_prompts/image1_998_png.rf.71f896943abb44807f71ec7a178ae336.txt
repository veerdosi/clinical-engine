The X-ray image displays the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges of the fingers. There is notable evidence of a fractured phalanx in one of the distal fingers, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion in the metacarpophalangeal joints, which could indicate trauma or inflammatory processes in the surrounding structures.
