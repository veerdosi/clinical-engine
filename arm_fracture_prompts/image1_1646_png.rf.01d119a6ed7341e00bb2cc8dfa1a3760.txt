The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of a human hand, focusing particularly on the phalanges and metacarpals of the third digit (middle finger). There is an observable deviation in the alignment of the distal phalanx, which may indicate a potential fracture or deformity impacting bone integrity. Furthermore, the presence of soft tissue swelling around the joints may suggest associated inflammatory processes or trauma in the region.
