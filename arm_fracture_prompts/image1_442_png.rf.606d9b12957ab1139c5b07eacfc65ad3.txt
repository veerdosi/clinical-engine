The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the left femur, highlighting an abnormal contour in the distal region, suggestive of possible angulation. There is evidence of decreased cortical bone density, indicating potential osteopenic changes or localized bone loss. Additionally, there is a visibility of irregularities in the joint space at the knee, which may suggest degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis.
