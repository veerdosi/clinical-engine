The image displays an X-ray of the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal structure of the fifth digit (little finger). There is visible discontinuity in the distal phalanx, indicating a potential fracture, characterized by an abnormal alignment of the bone fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the affected area, which could suggest the presence of localized edema associated with acute injury or inflammation.
