The X-ray of the left shoulder joint demonstrates an abnormality at the acromioclavicular joint, where there is evidence of potential osteolytic changes or sclerosis. The subacromial space appears narrowed, suggesting possible impingement due to soft tissue or bony abnormality such as an acromial spur. Additionally, the joint space is irregular, raising suspicion for degenerative changes or traumatic involvement, which could indicate underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or post-traumatic sequelae.
