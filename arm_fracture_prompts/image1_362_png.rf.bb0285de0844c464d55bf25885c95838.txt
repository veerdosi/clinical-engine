The X-ray image displays the right forearm, showing a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by a clear interruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is evidence of stabilization via intramedullary fixation, as indicated by the presence of a metal rod inserted into the medullary cavity of the radius. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable without any signs of acute swelling or abnormal gas formation related to potential complications.
