The radiograph depicts an anteroposterior view of the forearm, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of cortical disruption along the diaphysis of the radius, suggestive of a potential fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears compromised, indicating possible malalignment or deformity at the wrist joint.
