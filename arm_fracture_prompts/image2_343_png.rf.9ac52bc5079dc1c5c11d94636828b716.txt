The X-ray image presented is a lateral view of the right humerus, highlighting the proximal and distal aspects of the bone. Notably, there is a visible cortical disruption at the midshaft region, suggestive of a possible fracture or bone lesion. Additionally, there may be signs of potential joint effusion in the elbow joint area, which could indicate underlying inflammatory or degenerative changes.
