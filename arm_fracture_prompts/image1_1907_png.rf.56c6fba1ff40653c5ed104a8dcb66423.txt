The X-ray shows an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and associated soft tissue swelling. There is also evidence of possible associated ulnar deviation, which may indicate wrist malalignment. No significant joint displacement is noted, suggesting a stable fracture configuration.
