The radiograph depicts an anteroposterior (AP) view of the right knee joint, revealing an abnormal angulation of the femur proximal to the tibia. Additionally, there is evidence of a possible fracture line in the distal femur consistent with a transverse fracture, accompanied by signs of localized edema. Joint effusion is also noted, suggesting inflammatory processes or trauma affecting the knee joint architecture.
