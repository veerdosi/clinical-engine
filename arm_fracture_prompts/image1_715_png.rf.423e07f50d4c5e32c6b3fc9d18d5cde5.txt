The X-ray image demonstrates a clear view of the distal forearm and proximal wrist regions, highlighting the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and possible alignment issues. Additionally, there may be signs of a concomitant fracture in the ulnar aspect, suggesting a potential association with trauma or impact injury.
