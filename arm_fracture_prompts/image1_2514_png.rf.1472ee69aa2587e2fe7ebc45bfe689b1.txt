The X-ray image shows the distal radius and ulna with potential signs of a fracture or deformity in the wrist area, specifically involving the scaphoid and lunate bones. Radiolucent lines may indicate a fracture or increased bone resorption, possibly suggestive of underlying pathology such as osteomyelitis or a non-union. Additionally, joint spaces appear to be narrowed, which could signify degenerative changes or inflammatory processes affecting the carpal joints.
