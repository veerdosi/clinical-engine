The X-ray image of the right knee demonstrates a well-defined joint space between the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau, indicating normal alignment of the joint. Notably, there is a presence of osteophyte formation along the joint margins, which may suggest the development of osteoarthritis. Additionally, no evident signs of acute fracture or dislocation are observed, but the overall joint architecture appears altered, possibly indicating chronic degenerative changes.
