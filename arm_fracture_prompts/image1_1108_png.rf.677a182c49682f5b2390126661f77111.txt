The X-ray image demonstrates the lateral view of the distal femur and proximal tibia, highlighting the knee joint region. There is evidence of osteophyte formation around the joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and the development of bone spurs. Additionally, there is a noted alteration in the alignment of the patella, suggesting possible chondromalacia or other patellofemoral pathology.
