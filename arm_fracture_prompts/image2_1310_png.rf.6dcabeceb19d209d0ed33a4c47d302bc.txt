The X-ray image depicts a fracture in the distal radius, indicated by the displacement of the bone structure. There is the presence of an internal fixation device, likely a plate, which is utilized to stabilize the bone during the healing process. Surrounding the fracture site, there may be indications of soft tissue edema, which is commonly associated with acute fractures.
