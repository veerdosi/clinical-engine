The X-ray image shows the left shoulder joint and upper thoracic region, revealing normal anatomical structures such as the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus. There is a presence of metallic hardware in the region, suggestive of previous surgical intervention, possibly indicating a previous fracture or dislocation that required stabilization. Additionally, there may be signs of degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint, including slight bone spurring or joint space narrowing, which could imply underlying osteoarthritis.
