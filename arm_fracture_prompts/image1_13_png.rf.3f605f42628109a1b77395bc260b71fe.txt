The image presents a lateral view of the left hand, highlighting the phalanges and distal metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a malalignment and possible angulation observed in the distal phalanx, suggesting a potential fracture or deformity. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no signs of edema or remarkable soft tissue injury visible in the radiographic assessment.
