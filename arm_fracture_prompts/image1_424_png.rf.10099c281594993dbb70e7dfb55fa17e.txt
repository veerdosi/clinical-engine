The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal forearm structures, including the ulna and radius. There is evidence of an angular deformity at the forearm, which may indicate a malalignment or potential fracture in the area. Soft tissue swelling is also noted adjacent to the bony structures, suggesting possible trauma or inflammation.
