The X-ray image presented shows the left wrist in a clenched fist position, allowing for a clear view of the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of possible joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint space, which may indicate potential inflammatory processes or trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears normal, with no visible signs of fracture or dislocation observed in the carpal bones.
