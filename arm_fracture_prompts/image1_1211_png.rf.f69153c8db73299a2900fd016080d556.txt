The X-ray image presented shows the left hand, with particular emphasis on the metacarpal and phalangeal bones. Notably, the image reveals signs consistent with a fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a discontinuity in the bone cortex and a potential displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, the presence of soft tissue swelling may indicate associated contusion or hematoma in the surrounding areas, which is often seen in acute injuries.
