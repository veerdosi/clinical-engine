The X-ray image depicts a right wrist with an orthopedic implant, likely indicative of a previous surgical intervention for a distal radius fracture. Notable is the presence of a metal plate and screws, which are used for internal fixation, suggesting a recent or past fracture that required stabilization. The radiographic view shows proper alignment of the distal radius and ulna, but the visibility of the hardware may also suggest a potential complication such as nonunion or delayed union of the fracture.
