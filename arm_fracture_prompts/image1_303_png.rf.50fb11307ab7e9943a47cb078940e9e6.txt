The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left lower leg, including the tibia and fibula, demonstrating a mid-shaft fracture of the tibia characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is notable soft tissue edema present around the fracture site, suggesting associated trauma likely impacting the surrounding structures. The fibula appears intact, with no signs of fracture, and the knee joint above as well as the ankle joint below show normal alignment despite the presence of a fracture in the tibia.
