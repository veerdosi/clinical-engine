The X-ray depicts an anterior-posterior and lateral view of the left forearm, illustrating the ulna and radius. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by a disruption in the cortex, which may indicate instability. There are also signs of potential soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, which could suggest associated hematoma formation.
