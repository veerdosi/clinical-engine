The X-ray image depicts the phalanges of the hand, primarily focusing on the second through fifth digits. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in one or more of the distal phalanges, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and possible associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there may be an indication of osteoarthritic changes, such as joint space narrowing or marginal osteophyte formation, particularly at the interphalangeal joints.
