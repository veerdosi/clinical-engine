The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint, with notable visibility of the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. There is an evident joint effusion in the olecranon bursa region, which may suggest acute inflammatory processes. The bony margins appear intact without any signs of fracture or dislocation, although there may be subtle osteophyte formation indicative of early degenerative changes.
