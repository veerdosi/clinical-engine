The X-ray image displays the forearm bones, specifically the radius and ulna, in a supinated position. Notable findings include a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and possible angulation. There are also signs of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, suggesting associated periosteal reaction or hematoma formation.
