The X-ray image appears to show the left knee joint, including the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is a notable reduction in joint space, suggestive of osteoarthritis, which may present with marginal osteophyte formation. Additionally, the alignment of the joint appears compromised, indicating potential subluxation or misalignment that could be contributing to functional impairment.
