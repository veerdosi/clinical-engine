The X-ray image depicts the left lower extremity, specifically focusing on the tibia and fibula. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the tibia characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone integrity, leading to pronounced angulation. Additionally, there is a periosteal reaction evident along the fracture site, indicating potential callus formation as part of the healing process.
