The X-ray image displays the right elbow and forearm in a lateral view, indicating an angular deformity consistent with cubitus varus. Notably, there is a pronounced lateral angulation of the ulna with a potential associated joint misalignment, which may suggest a history of previous trauma. The radiographic appearance may also indicate changes in the geometry of the carrying angle, potentially leading to functional impairments in the elbow joint.
