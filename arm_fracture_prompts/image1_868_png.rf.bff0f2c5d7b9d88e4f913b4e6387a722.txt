The X-ray image displays the left knee joint, with particular attention to the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and patella. There is noticeable joint effusion within the suprapatellar recess, suggesting potential underlying pathology, such as osteoarthritis or synovitis. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is evident at the tibial plateau, indicative of degenerative changes often associated with chronic joint stress or inflammation.
