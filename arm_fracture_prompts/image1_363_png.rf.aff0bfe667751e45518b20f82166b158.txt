The X-ray image displays the humerus and proximal radius of the elbow joint, with notable radiopaque areas indicating potential abnormalities. There is evidence of a displacement or misalignment of the distal humerus, suggesting a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema or swelling consistent with traumatic injury in the region.
