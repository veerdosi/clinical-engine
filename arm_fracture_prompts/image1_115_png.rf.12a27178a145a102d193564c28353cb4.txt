The X-ray image presented reveals an AP view of the left wrist and hand. Notable findings include a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement and potential angulation, which may indicate a colles fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, suggesting a possible associated sprain or contusion.
