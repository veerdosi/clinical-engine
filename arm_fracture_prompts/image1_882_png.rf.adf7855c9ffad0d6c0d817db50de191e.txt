The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint in an anteroposterior view, revealing the structural alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a possible fracture or irregularity in the lateral aspect of the olecranon region, which could indicate a significant injury. Additionally, the presence of joint effusion is suggested by the outline of soft tissue density surrounding the joint, indicative of potential inflammatory or traumatic processes.
