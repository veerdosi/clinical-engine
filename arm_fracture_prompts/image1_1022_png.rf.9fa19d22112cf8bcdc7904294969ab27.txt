The X-ray image displays the bones of the wrist and hand, with emphasis on the carpal region and the metacarpals. There is evidence of an abnormal bone density, which may suggest osteopenia or osteoporosis in the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears disrupted, indicating a possible carpal instability or prior trauma affecting the anatomical positioning of the structures.
