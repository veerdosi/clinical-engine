The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right humerus and adjacent elbow joint, with notable radiolucency indicating a potential osteolytic lesion. There is an observable misalignment of the humeral shaft, suggesting a probable fracture or deformity at the mid-shaft, with possible involvement of the surrounding soft tissue. Additionally, the integrity of the articular surface of the elbow joint appears compromised, raising concerns regarding joint effusion or associated soft tissue injury.
