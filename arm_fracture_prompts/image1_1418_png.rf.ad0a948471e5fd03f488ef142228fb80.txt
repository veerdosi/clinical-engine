The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, revealing the glenohumeral joint and the surrounding anatomical structures, including the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, there is evidence of osteoporosis as indicated by reduced bone density, which may predispose the patient to fractures. Additionally, there is a prominent osteophyte formation on the acromion process, suggesting chronic degenerative changes consistent with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
