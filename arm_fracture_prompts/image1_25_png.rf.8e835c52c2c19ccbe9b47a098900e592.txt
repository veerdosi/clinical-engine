The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones and proximal phalanges. There is a noticeable alignment disturbance at the distal radius, indicative of a potential distal radius fracture or malunion. Additionally, the joint spaces appear preserved, suggesting no acute inflammatory changes or arthritic conditions are present at this time.
