The X-ray image reveals a transverse fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a clear disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex. Additionally, there is displacement noted at the fracture site, which may indicate an unstable fracture pattern. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no significant signs of soft tissue edema or hematoma observed in the immediate vicinity of the injury.
