The X-ray image reveals an apparent alignment anomaly in the distal femur and proximal tibia, suggestive of a malposition or deformity. Notably, there is a visible radiolucent area adjacent to the medial aspect of the tibia, which may indicate an osteolytic lesion or an abnormal bone density pattern consistent with potential pathological conditions. The joint spaces appear preserved, but the overall integrity of the osseous structures warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying fractures or pathological changes.
