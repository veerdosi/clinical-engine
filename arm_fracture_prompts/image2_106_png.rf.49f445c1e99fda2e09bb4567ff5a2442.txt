The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the knee joint, highlighting the presence of a surgical fixation device, indicating previous orthopedic intervention. Notable is the alignment of the femur and tibia, which appears consistent with post-surgical anatomy, alongside visible hardware such as screws and plates. There is evidence of potential post-operative changes such as surrounding soft tissue swelling or bone remodeling, which may suggest an inflammatory response or healing process related to a history of intra-articular injury or fracture.
