The X-ray image displays a right knee joint in an elongated anteroposterior view, revealing the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is a notable presence of joint effusion, indicated by a radiolucent area surrounding the patella, suggesting an underlying pathology such as a bursitis or synovitis. Additionally, the alignment of the articular surfaces appears altered, potentially indicative of a malalignment or previous trauma, warranting further clinical correlation.
