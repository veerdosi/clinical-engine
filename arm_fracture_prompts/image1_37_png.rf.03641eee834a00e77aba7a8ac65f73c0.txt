The X-ray image reveals the right forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna. There is the presence of a transverse fracture in the distal third of the radius, characterized by a disruption of cortical continuity, consistent with a traumatic injury. Additionally, subtle signs of periosteal reaction may indicate an associated soft tissue injury or callus formation.

The image also demonstrates mild angulation at the fracture site, which may lead to potential complications in anatomical alignment if not properly managed. No significant joint effusion is noted in the surrounding wrist joint, and there are no signs of osteomyelitis evident in the visualized bone structures. Overall, the findings suggest acute fracture pathology requiring further assessment and potential intervention.
