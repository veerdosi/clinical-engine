The X-ray image presents a clear view of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, demonstrating a possible fracture line across the mid-shaft of the radius. Additionally, there are signs of cortical irregularity indicating potential osteopenia or other underlying bone pathology. No obvious signs of callus formation or displacement are noted, which may suggest the fracture is recent and not yet in a healing phase.
