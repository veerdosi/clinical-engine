The X-ray image demonstrates the distal humerus, ulna, and radius, providing a lateral view of the human forearm. Notably, there is evidence of significant osteophyte formation at the elbow joint, indicative of osteoarthritis changes. Additionally, there appears to be a fracture line across the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a possible comminuted pattern, necessitating further evaluation for potential displacement or instability.
