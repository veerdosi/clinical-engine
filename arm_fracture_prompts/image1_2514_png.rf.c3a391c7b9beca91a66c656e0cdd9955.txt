The image displays a radiographic view of the right wrist, highlighting the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna. There appears to be a potential non-displaced fracture of the distal radius, characterized by an abrupt interruption of the cortical bone shadow and associated soft tissue swelling. No acute dislocation is observed, but there is evidence of periosteal reaction, indicating possible underlying pathology or previous trauma.
