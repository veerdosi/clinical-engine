The image presents a right shoulder X-ray, specifically highlighting the glenohumeral joint and the surrounding bony structures. Notably, there is a lucent area adjacent to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, suggestive of rotator cuff pathology, possibly indicating a tear or impingement. Additionally, the acromion appears to have an irregular contour, which may be consistent with acromioclavicular joint degeneration or osteoarthritis.
