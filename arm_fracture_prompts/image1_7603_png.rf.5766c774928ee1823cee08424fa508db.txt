The provided X-ray image demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the right shoulder girdle, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures. Notable findings include the presence of osteophyte formation along the glenoid fossa, which is indicative of osteoarthritis in the shoulder joint. Additionally, there is subacromial space narrowing, suggestive of impingement syndrome, alongside potential calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff, which can be inferred from the radiolucent area near the humeral head.
