The image depicts an X-ray of the forearm, illustrating the distal radius and ulna in the region of the wrist. Notably, there is a visible fracture evident in the distal radius, presenting with cortical disruption and potential misalignment of the fracture fragments. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the area, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury or traumatic hematoma formation.
