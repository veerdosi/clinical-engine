The X-ray image depicts a left knee joint that has undergone surgical intervention, evidenced by the presence of internal fixation devices, including screws and plates. The alignment of the femur, tibia, and fibula appears stable, however, there is an observable area of callus formation suggestive of a healing fracture, likely in the distal femur or proximal tibia region. Soft tissue swelling may be present around the joint, indicating potential post-operative inflammation or other associated complications.
