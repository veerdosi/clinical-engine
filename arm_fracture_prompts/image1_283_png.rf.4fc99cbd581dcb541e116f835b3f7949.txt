The X-ray image displays the proximal and middle phalanges of the second and third digits of the hand, with clear articulation at the metacarpophalangeal joints. There is evidence of osteophyte formation at the distal joints, suggestive of a degenerative process, potentially indicating osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a subtle reduction in joint space, which is commonly associated with chronic joint conditions.
