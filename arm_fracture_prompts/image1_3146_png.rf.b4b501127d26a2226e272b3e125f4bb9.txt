The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the distal femur and proximal tibia, highlighting the presence of an intramedullary fixation device, indicative of prior surgical intervention for a fracture. Notably, there is evidence of a comminuted fracture pattern in the lateral condyle of the femur, suggesting significant bone disruption. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears to be maintained, with no signs of malunion or infection observed in the surrounding soft tissue.
