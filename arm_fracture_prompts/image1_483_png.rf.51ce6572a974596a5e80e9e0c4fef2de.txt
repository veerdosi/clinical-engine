The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of the left hand, with particular emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpal bones. There appears to be an osteophyte formation at the base of the proximal phalanx, indicating possible degenerative joint disease, commonly associated with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is a noticeable soft tissue swelling around the joints, which may suggest an inflammatory process such as tenosynovitis or arthritis.
