The X-ray image depicts the right hand, showcasing the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal structures distinctly. Notably, there appears to be a fracture in the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by misalignment of the bone segments. Additional examination reveals signs of potential osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes in the metacarpophalangeal joints.
