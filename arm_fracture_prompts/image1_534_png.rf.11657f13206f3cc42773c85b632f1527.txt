The provided radiographic image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia, emphasizing the knee joint region. Evidence of joint effusion is observed, characterized by increased radiolucency suggesting the presence of excess fluid within the joint capsule. Additionally, the potential presence of osteophytes may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis, as seen by the irregular contour of the bone surfaces surrounding the joint.
