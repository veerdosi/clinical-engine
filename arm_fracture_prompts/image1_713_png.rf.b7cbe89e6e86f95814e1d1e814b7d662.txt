The X-ray image illustrates the left knee joint, with a notable presence of joint effusion, which suggests an accumulation of fluid within the articulation. There are observable osteophytes at the joint margins indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by degenerative changes in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Additionally, there appears to be a slight joint space narrowing, further supporting the diagnosis of chronic degenerative disease affecting the knee joint structure.
