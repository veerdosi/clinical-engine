The X-ray image depicts the phalanges of the hand, revealing the bony structures of the fingers. Notably, there appears to be a misalignment of the distal phalanx of the second finger, potentially indicative of a malunion or dislocation. Additionally, there may be evidence of soft tissue swelling around the affected area, suggesting an inflammatory response, which could be associated with trauma or underlying pathology.
