The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the left wrist, revealing the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, suggesting an inflammatory process, potentially indicative of a traumatic injury or synovitis. Additionally, mild osteophyte formation can be observed at the distal end of the radius, indicating possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis in the wrist joint.
