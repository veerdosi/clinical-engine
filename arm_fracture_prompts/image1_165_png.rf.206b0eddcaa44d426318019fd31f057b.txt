The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the left hand, revealing the phalangeal alignment of the first, second, and third digits. There is notable joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, suggestive of potential osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation along the joint margins may indicate degenerative joint disease affecting the hand's mobility and function.
