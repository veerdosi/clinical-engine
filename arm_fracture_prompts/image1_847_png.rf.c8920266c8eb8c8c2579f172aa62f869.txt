The image presents an X-ray of the knee joint, demonstrating the distal femur and proximal tibia with clear visualization of the femoral condyles and joint space. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicating potential pathology, which may be associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis. Additionally, the articular surfaces appear irregular, suggesting possible osteophyte formation, which is a common finding in degenerative joint disease.
