The X-ray image reveals the mid-forearm region, specifically the radius and ulna. There is an observable fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a distinct disruption in the cortical bone continuity, which may indicate acute traumatic injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the area of the fracture suggests a possible associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
