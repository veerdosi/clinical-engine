The X-ray images depict skeletal structures of the hand, illustrating the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, the image shows potential signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and possible marginal osteophyte formation at the first carpometacarpal joint. Additionally, there may be indications of a previous fracture or dislocation, evident through abnormal alignment or cortical disruption of the involved bones.
