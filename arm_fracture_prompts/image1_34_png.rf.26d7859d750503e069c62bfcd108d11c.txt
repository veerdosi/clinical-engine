The X-ray image displays the skeletal structures of the right hand, showcasing the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals. Notable findings include a potential avulsion fracture at the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may indicate a recent injury. Additionally, the alignment of the metacarpophalangeal joints appears within normal limits, with no evidence of joint effusion or degenerative changes observed in the radiocarpal joint.
