The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint with a focus on the proximal humerus and the glenoid cavity. There is an observed irregularity in the bony contour, suggestive of a probable humeral head deformity, which may indicate an underlying degenerative condition. Additionally, there is decreased joint space that could be associated with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, characterized by potential subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation, warranting further evaluation.
