The X-ray image displays a left shoulder joint with notable bony structures including the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. There is evidence of acromioclavicular joint space narrowing, which may suggest degenerative changes or osteoarthritis. Additionally, the projection indicates a potential rotator cuff pathology, as suggested by the positioning of the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity.
