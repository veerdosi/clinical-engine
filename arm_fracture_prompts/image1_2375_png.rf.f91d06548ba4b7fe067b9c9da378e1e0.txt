The X-ray image reveals a prominent angulation at the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, suggesting a possible boxer's fracture. There is evidence of bone fragmentation at the fracture site, accompanied by soft tissue swelling, indicative of underlying trauma. Additionally, alignment of the metacarpophalangeal joint appears disrupted, which may signify instability in the affected area.
