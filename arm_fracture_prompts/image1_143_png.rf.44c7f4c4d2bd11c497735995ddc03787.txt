The X-ray imaging displays a series of wrist views that demonstrate an irregularity in the carpal bones, likely indicative of a potential fracture or dislocation. Notably, there is an increase in radiolucency in the distal radius, which may suggest underlying osteopenia or a stress reaction. The alignment of the carpals appears compromised, indicating possible joint instability or capsular injury that may require further evaluation for assessment of ligamentous integrity.
