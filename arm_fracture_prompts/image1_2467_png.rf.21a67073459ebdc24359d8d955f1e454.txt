The radiograph displays the right wrist, with emphasis on the distal radius and the carpals. Notably, there is an intramedullary fixation device present within the distal radius, suggesting a history of fracture requiring surgical intervention. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no visible signs of acute trauma or significant degenerative changes.
