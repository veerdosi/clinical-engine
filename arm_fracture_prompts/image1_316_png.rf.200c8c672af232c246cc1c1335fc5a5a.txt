The X-ray image depicts a right shoulder, showing the anatomical structures including the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and the proximal humerus. There is a notable presence of subacromial space narrowing, which may suggest the potential for impingement syndrome or underlying rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, any visible osteophyte formation at the acromion or glenoid could indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis or chronic rotator cuff injury.
