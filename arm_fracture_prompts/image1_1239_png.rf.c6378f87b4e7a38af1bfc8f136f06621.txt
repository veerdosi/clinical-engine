The X-ray image displays the distal segment of a long bone, likely the femur, exhibiting a rigid fixation device, indicative of a prior surgical intervention, such as an open reduction and internal fixation. There is evidence of osseous trauma, characterized by radiolucent areas that suggest potential fracture lines or non-union at the surgical site. Additionally, signs of callus formation may be present around the fracture site, indicating the body's attempt at repairing osseous integrity following the injury.
