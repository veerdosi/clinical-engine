The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the distal humerus, exhibiting evidence of an intramedullary fixation device, specifically a plate and screws, indicating a history of surgical intervention likely related to a fracture. The alignment of the humerus appears to be within normal limits; however, there is possible evidence of nonunion or malunion due to the presence of the hardware. Surrounding soft tissue may show signs of edema or inflammation, which could be inferred from the radiolucent areas adjacent to the implant.
