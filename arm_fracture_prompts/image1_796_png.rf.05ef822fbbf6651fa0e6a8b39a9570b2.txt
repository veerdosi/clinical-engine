The X-ray image displays the left forearm, encompassing both the radius and ulna, illustrating a notable midshaft fracture of the radius, with associated cortical disruption. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction along the ulna, suggesting a potential response to the pathological process. Joint alignment appears intact; however, the radiographic findings indicate significant soft tissue swelling, which may correlate with acute trauma.
