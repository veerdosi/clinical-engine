The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the left knee joint. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency around the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau, suggestive of potential inflammatory or degenerative processes. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation at the joint margins implies underlying osteoarthritis, characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage and changes in subchondral bone.
