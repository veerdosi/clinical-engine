The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and the surrounding bony structures. There is evidence of potential degeneration, indicated by joint space narrowing, which may suggest osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the presence of subacromial spurring or calcifications around the acromion can reflect chronic impingement or inflammation in the shoulder region.
