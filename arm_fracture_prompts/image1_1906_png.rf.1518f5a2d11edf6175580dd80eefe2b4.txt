The radiographic image displays a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by angulation and displacement of the fracture fragments. There is also evidence of a surgical fixation device, indicating prior surgical intervention for stabilization. Additionally, the image shows changes in the soft tissue contours around the wrist, suggestive of edema or hematoma formation, commonly associated with acute fractures.
