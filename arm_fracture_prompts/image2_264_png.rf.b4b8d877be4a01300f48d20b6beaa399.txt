The image depicts an X-ray of the lower leg, showing both the tibia and fibula. Notable is the presence of a fracture line through the midshaft of the tibia, indicating a possible closed, transverse fracture. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction along the outer cortex, suggestive of healing or ongoing stress at the fracture site.
