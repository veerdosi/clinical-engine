The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right hand, showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and proximal phalanges. There is an observable fracture in the fifth metacarpal, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting a potential boxer's fracture. Adjacent soft tissues appear intact; however, slight edema may be present, indicating a possible acute inflammatory response to the fracture.
