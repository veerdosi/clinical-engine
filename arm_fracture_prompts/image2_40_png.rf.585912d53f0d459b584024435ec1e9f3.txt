The radiographic image demonstrates the left forearm in a lateral view, exhibiting the radius and ulna in their anatomical alignment. Notable is the presence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity, which may suggest an acute traumatic event. Additionally, there is potential evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which is commonly associated with such injuries.
