The X-ray image presents a clear view of the elbow joint in a standard anteroposterior projection. Notable findings include potential joint effusion and a subtle irregularity in the contour of the ulnar collateral ligament, suggestive of possible collateral ligament injury. Additionally, there is mild osteophyte formation at the olecranon process, which may indicate a degenerative change in the articular surfaces.
