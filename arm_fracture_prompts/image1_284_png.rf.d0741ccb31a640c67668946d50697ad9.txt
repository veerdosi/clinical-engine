The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, specifically the glenohumeral articulation, revealing the proximal humerus and scapula. Notably, there is evidence of degenerative changes, characterized by subchondral sclerosis and possible osteophyte formation, suggesting glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Additionally, slight irregularity in the acromion contour may indicate impingement syndrome or rotator cuff pathology.
