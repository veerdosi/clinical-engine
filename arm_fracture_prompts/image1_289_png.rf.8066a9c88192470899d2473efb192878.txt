The X-ray image displays the right humerus and a portion of the proximal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the midshaft of the humerus, characterized by a distinct cortical breach and potential displacement. Surrounding soft tissue edema may also be appreciated, suggesting an acute injury process.
