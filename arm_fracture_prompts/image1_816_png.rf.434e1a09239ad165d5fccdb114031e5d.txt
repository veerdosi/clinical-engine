The radiographic image displays the forearm and wrist, showing the ulna and radius along with the carpal bones. Notable in this image is a clear displacement of the distal radius, suggesting a possible distal radius fracture, commonly associated with trauma. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may indicate inflammation or hematoma formation related to the injury.
