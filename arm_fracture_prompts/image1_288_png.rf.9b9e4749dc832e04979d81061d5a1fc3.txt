The X-ray images depict the distal radius and ulna in the forearm, with an emphasis on the wrist joint. Notable is the presence of a dorsal angulation of the distal radius, indicative of a possible Colles' fracture, which is characterized by its location approximately 1-2 cm proximal to the wrist joint. Additionally, soft tissue edema and potential bone irregularities suggest underlying trauma or inflammatory processes adjacent to the fracture site.
