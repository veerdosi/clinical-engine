The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left forearm, clearly demonstrating the alignment of the radius and ulna bones. There is notable evidence of a fracture pattern observed in the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and potential displacement. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site appears to show signs of edema, indicating possible associated soft tissue injury.
