The X-ray image presents the anterior-posterior (AP) view of the lower limb, highlighting the forefoot and the mid-portion of the distal radius and ulna in the forearm. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by displacement and angulation, which is indicative of potential instability in the fracture site. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed around the fracture, suggesting an associated traumatic event that calls for further clinical correlation and assessment.
