The X-ray image depicts the left wrist, specifically highlighting the distal radius and ulna along with the carpal bones. There is evidence of an intra-articular fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by misalignment and potential displacement of the fracture fragments. Swelling and soft tissue edema may also be inferred from the radiographic appearance, indicating possible associated ligamentous injury or contusion in the region.
