The X-ray image depicts the phalanges of the hand, specifically focusing on the second digit, which appears to exhibit a significant angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint. There is evidence of potential bony deformity, possibly indicative of a malalignment or fracture. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, suggesting the presence of degenerative changes or arthritic conditions in the adjoining joint structures.
