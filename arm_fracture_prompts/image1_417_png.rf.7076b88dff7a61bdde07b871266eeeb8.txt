The X-ray image reveals a clear view of the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges of the wrist and hand. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture with angular displacement, accompanied by potential involvement of the ulnar styloid. Additionally, the alignment of the wrist joint indicates possible signs of joint effusion or other abnormalities associated with acute trauma.
