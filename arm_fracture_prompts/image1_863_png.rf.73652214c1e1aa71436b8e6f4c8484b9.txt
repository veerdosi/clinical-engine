The X-ray image depicts the humerus, revealing a notable presence of an intramedullary nail, suggesting a history of surgical intervention related to a fracture. The bone shaft shows signs of malalignment, which could indicate a previous fracture that did not heal in proper anatomical position. Additionally, cortical irregularities around the site of the implant may suggest potential complications such as nonunion or delayed union.
