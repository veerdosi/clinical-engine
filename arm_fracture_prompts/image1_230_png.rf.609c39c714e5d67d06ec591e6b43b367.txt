The image presents a right wrist X-ray demonstrating the carpal and metacarpal bones in an anteroposterior view. There is notable evidence of a fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a fracture line and displacement of the bone segments. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observed at the radiocarpal joint, which could indicate the presence of degenerative joint disease or other underlying pathological conditions.
