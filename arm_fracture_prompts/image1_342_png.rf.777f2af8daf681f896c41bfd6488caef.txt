The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint, with a focus on the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an angular deformity indicating a potential malalignment of the distal humerus and proximal forearm bones, which may suggest underlying pathology such as a fracture or developmental anomaly. Additionally, there appears to be a loss of normal joint congruity, which could be associated with joint effusion or osteoarthritis.
