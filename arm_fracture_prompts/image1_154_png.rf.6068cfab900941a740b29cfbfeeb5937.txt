The X-ray image depicts the phalanges of a finger, showing a potential loss of cortical bone integrity and the presence of a lucent lesion consistent with a possible fracture or bone pathology. Notably, there is a visible displacement at the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicating the possibility of a joint effusion or soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area. The alignment of the phalanges appears compromised, which may suggest the presence of an underlying deformity or trauma-related condition.
