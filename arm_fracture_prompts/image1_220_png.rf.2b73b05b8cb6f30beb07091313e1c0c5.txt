The provided X-ray image displays the right forearm, including both the radius and ulna. Observations reveal a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction that may indicate a healing response, as well as altered alignment of the radius and ulna suggesting potential malalignment or instability.
