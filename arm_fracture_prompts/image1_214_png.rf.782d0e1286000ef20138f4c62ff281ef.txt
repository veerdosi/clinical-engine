The X-ray image depicts the right hand, with a clear view of the metacarpals and phalanges. There is evidence of a potential fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by an irregular cortical outline and possible misalignment. Additionally, there appears to be signs of swelling in the surrounding soft tissue, which may indicate an associated soft tissue injury or contusion.
