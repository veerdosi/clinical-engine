The X-ray image displays the right leg, specifically showing the tibia and fibula. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the distal tibia, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, adjacent to the fracture site, there are signs of periosteal reaction, indicating a potential response to underlying pathology or injury.
