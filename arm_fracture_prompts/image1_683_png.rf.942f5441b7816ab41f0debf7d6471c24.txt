The X-ray depicts the left shoulder region with clear visualization of the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, there is evidence of a bony irregularity along the greater tubercle of the humerus, which may indicate a potential rotator cuff tear or chronic tendinopathy. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, suggesting possible degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis in the glenohumeral joint.
