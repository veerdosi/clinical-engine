The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral articulation and surrounding bony structures. Notably, there is evidence of a potential humeral head displacement, which may suggest a dislocation or subluxation of the shoulder, accompanied by possible associated soft tissue abnormalities. Additionally, the presence of bony spurs or irregularities along the acromion may indicate osteophyte formation, consistent with degenerative joint disease processes in the shoulder region.
