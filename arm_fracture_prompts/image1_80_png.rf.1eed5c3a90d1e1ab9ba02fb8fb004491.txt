The X-ray image demonstrates a significant angulation of the humerus at the mid-shaft, suggesting a possible fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears compromised, indicating potential post-traumatic deformity or malunion secondary to the fracture. Soft tissue swelling adjacent to the elbow joint may also be observed, which is commonly associated with acute inflammatory changes or contusion.
