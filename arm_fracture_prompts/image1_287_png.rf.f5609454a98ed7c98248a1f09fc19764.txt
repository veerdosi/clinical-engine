The X-ray image displays an AP view of the left humerus and forearm, revealing an alignment irregularity consistent with malunion or nonunion. There is an observable metallic fixation device, indicating a history of surgical intervention, likely for a fracture repair. Additionally, periosteal reaction or callus formation may be noted around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process that could be compromised or delayed.
