The X-ray image appears to exhibit substantial radiolucency in the distal humerus, indicating the possibility of an underlying pathology such as a fracture or bone lesion. There is a notable irregularity in the cortical bone, which may suggest either a pathological process or a traumatic injury. Additionally, any associated soft tissue swelling or pelvic involvement is not clearly visible in this projection, warranting further imaging for comprehensive evaluation.
