The X-ray image demonstrates an apparent fracture in the radius, located approximately in the mid-shaft region. There is significant angulation and possible displacement at the site of the fracture, indicative of a traumatic injury that may require orthopedic intervention. The ulna appears intact; however, the alignment of both the radius and ulna needs further evaluation for any potential associated injuries.
