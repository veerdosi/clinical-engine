The X-ray demonstrates a transverse fracture of the midshaft of the radius and ulna, which appears to be displaced. The cortical integrity is compromised, with clear signs of disruption along the fracture line. Additionally, there may be soft tissue swelling associated with the fracture site, indicative of a possible hematoma formation.
