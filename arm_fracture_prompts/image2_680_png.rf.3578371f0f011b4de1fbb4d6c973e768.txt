The X-ray demonstrates an anteroposterior (AP) view of the left forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna. There is evidence of cortical disruption, indicative of a potential fracture, which may involve the metaphyseal region. Additionally, the presence of periosteal reaction may suggest underlying pathological processes, warranting further clinical correlation.
