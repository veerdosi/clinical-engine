The X-ray image displays an elongated view of the left forearm, revealing the radius and ulna in their anatomical positions. There is notable evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a cancellous bone disruption and potential angulation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, but the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site may show signs of edema.
