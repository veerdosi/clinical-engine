The X-ray image displays the lateral and anteroposterior views of the wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal bones. A notable fracture is observed at the distal radius, indicating a possible distal radius fracture, commonly associated with wrist injuries. Additionally, alignment of the carpal bones appears disrupted, suggesting the potential presence of a scaphoid or lunate dislocation, which may warrant further clinical investigation.
