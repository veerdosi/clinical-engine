The X-ray image demonstrates an anterior-posterior view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges of the index finger. There is evident angulation and possible fracture noted in the middle phalanx, with accompanying soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the distal phalanx appears intact, while there may be signs of potential joint involvement at the proximal interphalangeal joint.
