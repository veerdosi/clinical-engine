The X-ray image displays the forearm, revealing the radius and ulna in a relatively straight alignment, with no apparent fractures or dislocations noted. However, the distal radius shows signs of a potential bone lesion, which may suggest the presence of an underlying pathological condition such as a cyst or tumor. Additionally, the joint spaces at the wrist are preserved, indicating normal articular surfaces without evidence of osteoarthritis or significant degenerative changes.
