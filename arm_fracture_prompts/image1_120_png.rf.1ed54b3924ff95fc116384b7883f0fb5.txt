The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus, highlighting a potential angular deformity at the surgical neck region, suggestive of a humeral fracture. There is evidence of a possible displacement, as indicated by misalignment of the humeral head relative to the glenoid fossa. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue swelling may be noted, which could indicate an underlying hematoma or inflammatory response.
