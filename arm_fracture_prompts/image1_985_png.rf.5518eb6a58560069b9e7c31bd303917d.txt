The radiographic image depicts the right hand in a standard anteroposterior view. Notable findings include possible joint effusion in the metacarpophalangeal joints and an abnormal alignment of the proximal phalanges, suggesting a potential deformity such as a malrotation or subluxation. Additionally, there is evidence of bony overgrowth in the distal phalanx, which may indicate the presence of a benign bony lesion or osteophyte formation.
