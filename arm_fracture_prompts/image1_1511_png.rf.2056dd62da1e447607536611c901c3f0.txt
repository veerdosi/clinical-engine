The X-ray image presented shows the left lower extremity, specifically focused on the distal tibia and fibula. Significant radiolucency is observed in the cortex, indicating potential osteopenia or underlying pathological changes such as a stress fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction along the diaphysis, which may suggest an inflammatory process or possible trauma affecting the bony architecture.
