The radiographic image displays the left wrist and distal forearm, showcasing the bone structures including the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an evident distal radius fracture characterized by a dorsal angulation and potential displacement, indicating trauma to the wrist area. Additionally, there is a slight widening of the distal radioulnar joint space, suggesting the possibility of a corresponding injury to the ulnar styloid process, which may be indicative of a complex fracture-dislocation pattern.
