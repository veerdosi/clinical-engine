The X-ray image reveals an instance of a right humeral fracture with the presence of an internal fixation device, indicating surgical intervention for stabilization. There is evident bony disruption at the distal humerus, characterized by irregular alignment and callus formation, suggestive of a healing process. Additionally, there is a visible joint effusion around the elbow joint, which may indicate inflammatory changes or potential complications related to the fracture.
