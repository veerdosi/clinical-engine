The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and the proximal carpal bones of the wrist. There is notable evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a cortical disruption and displacement indicative of a possible fracture pattern. Additionally, possible associated soft tissue swelling may be inferred, given the radiolucency that can often accompany such fractures involving the wrist area.
