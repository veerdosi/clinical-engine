The X-ray image reveals the lateral view of the left upper limb, showing the humerus, ulna, and radius. There is evidence of a fracture along the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity, with potential displacement noted. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed around the fracture site, indicating trauma and possible hematoma formation.
