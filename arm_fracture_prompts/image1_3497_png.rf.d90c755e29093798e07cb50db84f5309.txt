The X-ray image reveals a transverse fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in continuity of the bone cortex. There is an incomplete fracture line noted, with evidence of comminution at the fracture site, suggesting a potential for instability. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, and there is no visible joint effusion or associated injury to the carpal bones.
