The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint, showcasing the distal humerus, the olecranon process of the ulna, and the proximal radius. There is notable evidence of an acute fracture at the lateral condyle of the humerus, characterized by a clear disruption in the bony cortex and displacement of the fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed surrounding the joint, which may indicate a potential associated hematoma or joint effusion.
