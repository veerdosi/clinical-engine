The X-ray image displays a left forearm, including the distal humerus, proximal radius, and proximal ulna. There is an observable angulation deformity at the mid-shaft of the radius, suggestive of a possible fracture or malunion, which is characterized by abnormal alignment of the bony structures. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the fracture site, indicating potential acute inflammation or hematoma formation related to the underlying injury.
