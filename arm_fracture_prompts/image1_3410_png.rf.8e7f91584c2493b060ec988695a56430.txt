The X-ray image demonstrates a left elbow joint with evidence of surgical intervention, indicated by the presence of an orthopedic screw positioned along the distal aspect of the humerus. There is a visible disruption of normal bone architecture, potentially indicating a past fracture that has been internally stabilized. The surrounding soft tissues and joint space appear unremarkable, but the presence of hardware suggests a history of orthopedic pathology necessitating surgical repair.
