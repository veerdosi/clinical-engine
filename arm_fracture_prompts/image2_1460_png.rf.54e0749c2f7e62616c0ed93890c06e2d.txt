The X-ray image depicts an acute fracture of the ulna, characterized by a complete transverse break through the diaphysis. There is also notable swelling around the fracture site, possibly indicating the presence of soft tissue trauma such as contusion or hematoma formation. The alignment of the distal segments shows misalignment, suggestive of a significant fracture displacement.
