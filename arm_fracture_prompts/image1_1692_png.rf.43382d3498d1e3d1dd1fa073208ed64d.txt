The image presents an X-ray of the left forearm, demonstrating a clear view of the radius and ulna. There is notable displacement of the distal radius, indicative of a potential fracture or instability in the radial structure, which may suggest a fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint is observed, which can be consistent with associated soft tissue injury or edema in response to underlying osseous abnormalities.
