The X-ray image reveals a displacement of the clavicle, indicating a potential clavicular fracture. The alignment of the acromioclavicular joint appears abnormal, which may suggest an associated acromioclavicular injury. Additionally, there is loss of continuity in the cortical bone of the clavicle, indicative of a fracture with possible fragmentation or displacement.
