The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the right hand, highlighting the phalangeal bones and the metacarpals. Notable radiolucency is observed in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, indicating a potential fracture or bone resorption. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion in the metacarpophalangeal joint, which may suggest underlying inflammatory processes or trauma.
