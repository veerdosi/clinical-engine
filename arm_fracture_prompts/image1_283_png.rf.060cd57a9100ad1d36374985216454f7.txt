The image displays a lateral radiograph of the left shoulder and upper arm, highlighting the proximal humerus structure. Notable in the x-ray is an observable cortical disruption along the humeral shaft, which may indicate a potential fracture or pathological lesion. Additionally, the alignment of the glenohumeral joint appears altered, suggesting possible dislocation or significant joint deterioration in the shoulder region.
