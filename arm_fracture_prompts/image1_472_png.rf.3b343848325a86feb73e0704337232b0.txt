The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormality in the left humerus, with a notable radiolucent area indicating a possible fracture or bone cyst. Additionally, signs of joint effusion are observed within the glenohumeral joint, suggesting potential underlying pathology such as bursitis or inflammatory arthropathy. The alignment of the elbow demonstrates irregularity, raising suspicion for malunion or post-traumatic changes that may affect joint function.
