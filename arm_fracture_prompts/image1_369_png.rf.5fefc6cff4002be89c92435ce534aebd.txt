The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna in the elbow region. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating a possible angular deformity at the fracture site.
