The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus and glenohumeral joint. Notably, there is evidence of a humeral head deformity characterized by irregular contour, which may suggest the presence of osteonecrosis or a possible fracture. Additionally, signs of joint effusion may be observed in the glenohumeral joint space, indicating potential inflammatory processes such as bursitis or arthritis.
