The X-ray image shows a right elbow with an intramedullary nail and screws in place, indicating a previous surgical intervention, likely for stabilizing a fracture. There is evidence of an angular deformity at the distal humerus, suggestive of malalignment or improper healing post-injury. Soft tissue swelling may also be inferred around the joint, which could indicate trauma or inflammatory processes associated with the fracture repair.
