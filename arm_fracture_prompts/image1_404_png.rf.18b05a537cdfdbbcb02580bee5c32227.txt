The X-ray image displays the left shoulder region, including the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding soft tissues. Notable findings include the presence of an osseous irregularity, which may suggest osseous changes such as osteophyte formation or potential degenerative joint disease. The joint space appears narrowed and may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or subchondral cyst formation affecting the glenohumeral joint.
