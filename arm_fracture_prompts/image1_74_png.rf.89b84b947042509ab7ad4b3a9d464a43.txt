The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the humerus and forearm, demonstrating a potential fracture in the radial shaft. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating either a complete or incomplete fracture characterized by angulation or displacement. Additional soft tissue swelling may be noted around the elbow joint, which could suggest an associated hematoma or contusion.
