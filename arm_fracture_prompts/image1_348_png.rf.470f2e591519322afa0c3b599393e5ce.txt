The X-ray image displays the right knee joint with clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable findings include joint space narrowing indicative of potential osteoarthritis, with possible subchondral sclerosis observed in the femoral condyles. Additionally, there is a presence of osteophyte formation around the joint margins, suggesting chronic degenerative changes.
