The X-ray image demonstrates an internal fixation device, likely a plate and screws, affixed to the diaphysis of a fractured radius. There is evidence of a healed fracture with callus formation surrounding the fracture site, indicating a prior injury and subsequent surgical intervention. Additionally, the alignment of the radius appears acceptable, with no acute deformities observed in the surrounding soft tissues.
