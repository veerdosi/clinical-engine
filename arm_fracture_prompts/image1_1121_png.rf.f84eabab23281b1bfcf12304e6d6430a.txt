The X-ray image displays the right wrist in two views: anteroposterior (AP) and oblique. There is evidence of joint effusion within the radiocarpal joint space, indicated by increased soft tissue density. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes at the distal radius suggests degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. 

Noteworthy is the reported joint space narrowing in the radioulnar joint, which is typically associated with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The subluxation of the scaphoid may also be observed, which can complicate the overall joint stability. No acute fractures are evident; however, the observed bony changes could lead to future functional impairment.
