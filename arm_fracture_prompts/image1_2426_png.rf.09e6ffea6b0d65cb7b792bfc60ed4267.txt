The X-ray image displays a right hand with notable alignment of the phalanges and metacarpals. There are signs of a possible bony abnormality or deformity affecting the middle phalanx of the fourth digit, which may suggest the presence of a fracture or malunion. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed, which may indicate early degenerative changes or inflammatory arthropathy affecting the distal interphalangeal joints.
