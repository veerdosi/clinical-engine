The X-ray image displays the right humeral head and proximal humerus, showing a possible fracture line localized at the surgical neck of the humerus. There is also evidence of increased radiolucency around the fracture site, suggesting the presence of edema or possible bone resorption indicative of a pathological process. Additionally, the morphology of the humeral head appears altered, which may suggest underlying degenerative changes or avascular necrosis.
