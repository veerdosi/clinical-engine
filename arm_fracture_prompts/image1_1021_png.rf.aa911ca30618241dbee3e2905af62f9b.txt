The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, revealing possible signs of glenohumeral dislocation, which is characterized by the humeral head being displaced from its normal anatomical position. Additionally, there is evidence of potential acromioclavicular joint involvement, suggesting possible acromioclavicular joint separation. The surrounding soft tissue may exhibit edema, indicating inflammatory changes consistent with a traumatic injury to the shoulder region.
