The X-ray demonstrates a clear view of the skeletal structure of the hand, particularly the phalangeal bones of the fingers. Notable abnormalities include the presence of a possible fracture in one of the proximal phalanges accompanied by angulation at the fracture site. Additionally, there may be evidence of osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis in the distal interphalangeal joints.
