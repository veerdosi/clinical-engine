The image depicts a radiographic view of the forearm, illustrating both the radius and ulna. Notable in the image is a markedly angulated fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone and an associated deformation. The ulna appears intact, but the alignment of the forearm suggests possible secondary complications such as instability or malalignment.
