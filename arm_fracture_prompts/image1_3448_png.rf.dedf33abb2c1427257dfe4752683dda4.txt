The X-ray displays the left hand, prominently illustrating the architectural integrity of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a notable angular deformity present at the proximal interphalangeal joints, potentially indicative of a malalignment or subluxation. The radiographic density appears uniform across the skeletal structures, with no visible signs of acute fracture or dislocation, although surrounding soft tissues may warrant further assessment for inflammation or edema.
