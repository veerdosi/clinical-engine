The X-ray of the left shoulder demonstrates a glenohumeral joint with potential signs of subacromial impingement. Notable is the presence of an osteophyte formation along the acromion, which may contribute to abutment against the supraspinatus tendon. Additionally, there is a possibility of moderate joint effusion, which could indicate underlying inflammatory processes such as rotator cuff tendinopathy or bursitis.
