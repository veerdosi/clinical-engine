The X-ray image depicts the left wrist and hand, showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges in various orientations. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the scaphoid bone, associated with signs of edema in the surrounding soft tissue, indicating acute injury. Additionally, there may be changes suggestive of arthritis in the joint spaces of the first carpometacarpal joint, as evidenced by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
