The X-ray image reveals a clear fracture in the mid-shaft of the tibia, characterized by a distinct disruption in cortical continuity. There is evidence of periosteal reaction, indicative of the body's response to the fracture. The fibula appears intact, and soft tissue swelling may be inferred adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting associated soft tissue injury.
