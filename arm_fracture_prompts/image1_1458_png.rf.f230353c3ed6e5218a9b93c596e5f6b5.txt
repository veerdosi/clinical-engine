The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus. There is evidence of a potential bony deformity at the proximal humerus, suggesting the possible presence of a fracture or dislocation. Additionally, the acromion and distal clavicle appear intact, with no dislocation or subluxation observable in the coracoacromial arch.

Notable soft tissue structures around the shoulder joint are not well-defined in this projection; however, joint effusion cannot be conclusively ruled out. The glenohumeral joint space seems preserved, indicating the absence of significant degenerative change. Further imaging may be warranted to assess the integrity of the rotator cuff tendons in relation to any noted abnormalities.
