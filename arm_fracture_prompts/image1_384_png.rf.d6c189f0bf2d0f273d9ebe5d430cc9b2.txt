The radiograph displays the wrist joint and the distal radius and ulna, with clear visualization of the carpal bones. Notably, there is a loss of joint space between the proximal carpal bones, which may be indicative of early osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of sclerosis around the distal radius suggests underlying degenerative changes or chronic inflammation.
