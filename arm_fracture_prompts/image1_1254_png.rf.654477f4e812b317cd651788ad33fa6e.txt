The image presents an X-ray of the left arm, with a highlighted focus on the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. There is evidence of an angular deformity at the mid-shaft of the ulna, which may indicate a possible fracture or malunion. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear to be unchanged, and no significant signs of edema or effusion are visualized in the region of interest.
