The image presents an anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view of the right forearm. Notable is an angular deformity of the distal radius, suggesting malunion or a potential undiagnosed fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the ulnar and radial bones indicates possible instability or dislocation at the proximal radioulnar joint.
