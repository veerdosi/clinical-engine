The X-ray image displays the left wrist, emphasizing the distal radius and ulna. Notable is a significant angulation at the distal radius, indicative of a possible distal radius fracture, along with associated soft tissue swelling. The alignment of the carpal bones appears preserved, but further assessment may be necessary to evaluate for potential intra-articular involvement.
