The X-ray image demonstrates the left forearm, revealing both the radius and ulna in a lateral projection. Notably, there is an evident radial fracture, characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity, along with potential displacement. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit mild swelling, indicating possible contusion or hematoma formation associated with the fracture.
