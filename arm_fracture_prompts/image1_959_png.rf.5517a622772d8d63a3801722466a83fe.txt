The X-ray shows a lateral view of the left humerus, highlighting a surgical implant within the diaphysis, indicative of previous orthopedic intervention. There are signs of cortical irregularity surrounding the implant, which may suggest either inflammatory changes or a response to bone remodeling. Additionally, the presence of surrounding soft tissue shadowing could indicate possible edema or soft tissue involvement in the area of interest.
