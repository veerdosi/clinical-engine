The X-ray image depicts the glenohumeral joint with evidence of joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the joint space. There is a notable subacromial spur formation, suggesting possible impingement syndrome. Additionally, signs of osteoarthritic changes are observed, including joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis around the humeral head.
