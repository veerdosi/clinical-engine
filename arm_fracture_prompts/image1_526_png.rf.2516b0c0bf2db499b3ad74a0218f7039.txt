The image presented is a lateral radiograph of the right elbow, displaying multiple metallic implants indicative of surgical intervention, likely due to a fracture. Notable deformities include malalignment of the distal humerus and evidence of a post-operative status with the presence of surgical hardware such as plates and screws. The surrounding soft tissue shows signs of increased density, potentially indicating edema or inflammation associated with the surgical procedure.
