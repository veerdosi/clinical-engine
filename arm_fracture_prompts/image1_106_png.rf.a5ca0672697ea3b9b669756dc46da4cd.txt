The X-ray image reveals the bony architecture of the right hand, showcasing the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals. Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, degenerative changes may be observed in the distal joints, indicating possible osteoarthritic changes.
