The X-ray image displays the wrist joint, emphasizing the radiolucent and radiopaque structures of the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is notable displacement of the distal radius, suggestive of a distal radius fracture, with accompanying soft tissue swelling around the wrist. Additionally, signs of joint effusion are present, indicating potential synovitis or trauma in the surrounding structures.
