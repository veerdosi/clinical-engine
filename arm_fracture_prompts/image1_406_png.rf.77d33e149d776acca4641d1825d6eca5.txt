The X-ray image displays the forearm, revealing the radius and ulna in a standard anteroposterior view. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a transverse line across the cortical bone, indicating a disruption in the normal bone integrity. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reactions along the ulna, suggesting a potential inflammatory process at the site of injury.
