The radiograph of the right hand demonstrates the osseous structures including the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notably, there is evidence of mild osteopenia, characterized by reduced bone density, appearing particularly pronounced in the metaphyseal regions of the phalanges. Additionally, the joint spaces are aligned normally, without signs of acute fractures or dislocations, but there may be subtle irregularities suggestive of early degenerative changes in the interphalangeal joints.
