The X-ray image displayed shows a lateral view of the left forearm, including both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of potential cortical disruption along the mid-shaft of the radius, which raises suspicion for a fracture or stress-related injury. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears compromised, suggesting the possibility of associated dislocation or instability.
