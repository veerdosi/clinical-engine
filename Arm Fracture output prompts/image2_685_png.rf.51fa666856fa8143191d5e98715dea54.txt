The X-ray displays a lateral view of the left humerus, showcasing an intramedullary fixation device within the medullary canal. There is evidence of a fracture, positioned in the mid-diaphysis of the humerus, characterized by angulation and possible displacement. Surrounding the fracture site, there may be signs of callus formation, indicating the healing process, along with potential soft tissue edema evident in the adjacent soft tissue structures.
