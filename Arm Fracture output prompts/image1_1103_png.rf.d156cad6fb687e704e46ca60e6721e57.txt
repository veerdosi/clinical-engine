The provided X-ray image depicts the right upper extremity, focusing on the wrist and forearm. There is an apparent misalignment of the distal radius, suggesting a possible fracture or deformity of the bone, characterized by an angulation in the distal fragment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted in the periarticular region, which could indicate an inflammatory response associated with the underlying bony injury.
