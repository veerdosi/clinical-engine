The X-ray image demonstrates the skeletal structure of the right hand, revealing clear visualization of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable findings include joint spacing and alignment in the proximal interphalangeal joints, with no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation present in the examined fingers. The radiological assessment suggests a potential subluxation or deformity in the alignment of the distal phalanges, warranting further clinical correlation for any underlying pathology.
