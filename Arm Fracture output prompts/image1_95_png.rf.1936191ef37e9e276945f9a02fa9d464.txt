The X-ray image presents a clear view of the distal radius and ulna, displaying a significant bowing deformity in the forearm bones. Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture or stress injury, characterized by a visible discontinuity in the cortical bone in the ulna. Additionally, joint alignment issues may be present at the wrist, suggesting associated soft tissue or ligamentous injury.
