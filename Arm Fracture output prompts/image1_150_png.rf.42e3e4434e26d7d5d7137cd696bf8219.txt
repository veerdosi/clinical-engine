The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of a cortical disruption at the midshaft of the radius, suggestive of a potential fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the forearm bones appears abnormal, indicating possible malalignment or angulation that may be clinically relevant.
