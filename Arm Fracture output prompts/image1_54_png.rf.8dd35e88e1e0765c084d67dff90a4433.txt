The image presents an anteroposterior (AP) view and a lateral view of the forearm, illustrating the radius and ulna. The radiographs reveal a significant angulation deformity of the distal radius, consistent with a Colles' fracture, characterized by dorsal angulation and often associated with wrist pain. Additionally, there is evidence of possible periosteal reaction along the ulnar shaft, suggesting chronic stress or injury at the site.
