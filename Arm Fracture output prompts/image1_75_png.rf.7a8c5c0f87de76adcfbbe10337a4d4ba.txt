The image depicts a lateral view of the left forearm and wrist, revealing the radius and ulna bones. There is notable displacement and angulation at the distal radius, indicative of a possible distal radius fracture, commonly associated with trauma. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint may suggest accompanying contusions or ligamentous injuries.
