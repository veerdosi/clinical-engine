The X-ray image demonstrates the right shoulder region, specifically visualizing the proximal humerus, scapula, and the glenohumeral joint. Notable findings include possible changes in the morphology of the humeral head, raising suspicion for proximal humeral deformities which may indicate underlying pathologies such as avascular necrosis or osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be evidence of degenerative changes in the surrounding articulating surfaces, highlighted by the alteration in joint space and cortical contours.
