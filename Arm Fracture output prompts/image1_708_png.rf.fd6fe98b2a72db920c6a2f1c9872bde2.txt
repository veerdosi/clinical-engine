The X-ray image reveals a left humerus with noticeable cortical irregularities, suggestive of potential underlying pathology. There is evidence of periosteal reaction along the diaphysis, indicating possible chronic inflammation or a neoplastic process. Additionally, the joint spaces appear maintained, but further evaluation may be necessary to rule out any associated joint pathology or muscle involvement.
