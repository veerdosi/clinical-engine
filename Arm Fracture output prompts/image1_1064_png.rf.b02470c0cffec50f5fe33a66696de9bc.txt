The X-ray image of the wrist demonstrates a visible fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is an indication of potential dorsal angulation and volar tilt of the distal fragment, suggestive of a Colles' fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no signs of dislocation or associated soft tissue abnormalities.
