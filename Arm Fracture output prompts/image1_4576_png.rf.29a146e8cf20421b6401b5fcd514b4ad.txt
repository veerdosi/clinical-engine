The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the hand, showing a series of bones aligned in a reasonable anatomical position. Notable are the joint spaces, which appear moderately preserved, though there is evidence of possible subluxation involving the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there is potential evidence of osteophyte formation at the distal interphalangeal joint, suggesting possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
