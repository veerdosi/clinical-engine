The X-ray image displays a right hand, showing an apparent alignment of the carpal and metacarpal bones with the phalanges. Notably, there is a potential fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone, indicative of an acute or subacute injury. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling around the affected area, which could suggest associated hematoma or inflammation.
