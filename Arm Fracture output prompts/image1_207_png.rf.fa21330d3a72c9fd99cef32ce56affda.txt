The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, clearly showing the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, presenting with a disruption of the cortical bone and overlying soft tissue. Additionally, signs of periosteal reaction may suggest involvement of the periosteum, which can indicate acute trauma or a healing response around the fracture site.
