The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left humerus, highlighting a potential area of concern at the proximal end. Notably, there is evidence of a lytic bone lesion in the humeral head, which could suggest a pathological process such as osteolysis possibly due to metastatic disease or primary bone tumor. Additionally, the surrounding cortex appears intact, indicating that there is no current periosteal reaction or evident fracture.
