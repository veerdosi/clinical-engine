The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint in a lateral view, revealing the anatomy of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable in this image is the presence of a possible osteophyte formation at the olecranon process, which may indicate degenerative joint changes, such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, which could suggest a pathological process affecting the cartilage within the elbow joint.
