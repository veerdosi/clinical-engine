The radiograph depicts the right distal humerus, demonstrating surgical fixation with a plate and screws, indicating a prior fracture management. Notable is the presence of periosteal reaction along the fracture site, suggesting a history of significant trauma or surgical intervention. Additionally, there is cortical disruption evident, consistent with a post-traumatic or post-surgical change in the bone structure.
