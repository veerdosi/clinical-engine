The image presents an anteroposterior view of the right wrist, highlighting the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and alignment irregularities. Additionally, the joint space between the wrist bones appears compromised, suggesting a potential risk of complex regional pain syndrome or other post-fracture complications.
