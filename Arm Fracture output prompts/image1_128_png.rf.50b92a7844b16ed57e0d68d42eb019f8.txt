The x-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the shoulder joint, highlighting the humerus and proximal features associated with the upper arm. Notably, there is evidence of a possible humeral head deformity, characterized by irregular contour or surface changes that may suggest underlying osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis. Additionally, the visualized joint space exhibits narrowing, indicating potential degenerative changes or joint pathology affecting mobility and function.
