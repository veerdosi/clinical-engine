The X-ray image of the left knee joint displays joint space narrowing, indicative of potential degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. There is also evidence of subchondral sclerosis, which suggests increased bone density beneath the cartilage surface, commonly associated with chronic joint stress. The alignment of the bones appears normal, but there are no visible fractures or acute traumatic injuries in the observed area.
