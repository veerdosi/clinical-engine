The X-ray image demonstrates a left shoulder joint with the presence of an orthopedic implant, indicative of a prior surgical intervention such as arthroplasty or stabilization. Notably, there is a subtle deformity of the humeral head, which may suggest a previous fracture or dislocation event that required surgical correction. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no evident signs of acute inflammation or edema in the immediate vicinity of the implant.
