The X-ray image reveals a right forearm with clear visualization of the radius and ulna. There is an anomaly present: an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone continuity and associated soft tissue edema. Additionally, there are signs of potential joint effusion observed in the radiocarpal joint space, indicating possible inflammatory changes.
