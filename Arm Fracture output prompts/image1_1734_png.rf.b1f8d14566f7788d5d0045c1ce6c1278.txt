The X-ray image reveals a clear view of the proximal tibia and fibula, showing an angulated deformity at the mid-shaft of the bones. There is evidence of a sharp cortical disruption indicative of a potential fracture, with irregular alignment between the fragments. Additionally, there is surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may suggest a concomitant hematoma or inflammation related to the identified fracture.
