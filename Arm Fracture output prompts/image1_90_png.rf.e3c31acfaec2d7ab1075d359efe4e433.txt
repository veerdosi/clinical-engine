The x-ray image depicts a right hand with clear visualization of the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notable in the image is the presence of an osteophyte formation at the base of the metacarpal bones, suggesting a degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be joint space narrowing between the first metacarpal and the trapezium, which may indicate degenerative changes in the carpometacarpal joint.
