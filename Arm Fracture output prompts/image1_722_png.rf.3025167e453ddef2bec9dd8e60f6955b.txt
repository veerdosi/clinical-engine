The X-ray demonstrates an oblique view of the right shoulder, highlighting the scapula and proximal humerus. There is a notable focal area of translucency in the bone cortex, which may indicate the presence of a potential benign lesion such as a cyst or a more concerning area requiring further evaluation. Additionally, joint spaces appear preserved, with no obvious signs of arthritic changes observed in the acromioclavicular joint.
