The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the elbow joint, where the presence of surgical hardware is evident. The metallic fixation device indicates prior surgical intervention, likely associated with the stabilization of a fracture in the distal humerus or proximal ulna. Observations of callus formation may suggest the healing process following an osteotomy or fracture fixation, while joint spaces appear preserved, indicating no significant degenerative changes at the current stage.
