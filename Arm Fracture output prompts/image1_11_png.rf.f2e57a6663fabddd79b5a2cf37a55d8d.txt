The X-ray image demonstrates the left lower extremity, specifically visualizing the femur, tibia, and fibula. There appears to be a misalignment of the tibial shaft, indicative of angular deformity, potentially suggestive of varus or valgus malalignment. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction along the tibial surface, which may indicate underlying pathology such as stress reactions or chronic conditions.
