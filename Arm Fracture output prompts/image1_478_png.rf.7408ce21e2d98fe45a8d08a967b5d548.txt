The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right knee joint, indicating potential joint pathology. Notable findings include a narrowed joint space, suggestive of osteoarthritis, as well as the presence of osteophytes at the margins of the femur and tibia, indicative of degenerative joint disease. The alignment of the femur and tibia appears to be largely preserved, with no acute fractures evident in the visualized osseous structures.
