The X-ray image demonstrates an alignment of the right distal radius and ulna, showing a notable deformity characterized by dorsal angulation. A pronounced osteophyte formation is observed at the distal articulation, suggesting the potential presence of osteoarthritis. Soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint may indicate underlying inflammation or traumatic pathology affecting the surrounding structures.
