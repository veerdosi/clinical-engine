The X-ray image displays the left hand, prominently showing the phalanges and metacarpals of the fingers. Notable in the radiograph are metallic fixation devices, suggesting a history of surgical intervention, likely indicating the presence of a fracture or dislocation in the hand. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, with potential evidence of malunion or nonunion at the surgical site, necessitating further clinical evaluation.
