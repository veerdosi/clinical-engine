The X-ray image of the hand reveals the presence of multiple distal phalangeal fractures, characterized by discontinuity in the cortical bone and soft tissue swelling. There is also notable intra-articular involvement at the distal interphalangeal joints, indicating potential complications such as joint instability or osteoarthritis. The surrounding soft tissues demonstrate edema, suggesting an inflammatory response secondary to the bony injuries.
