The X-ray image shows a left shoulder joint with the presence of an orthopedic implant, indicating a prior surgical intervention, possibly for a fracture or instability. Notable is a potential humeral head deformity, with an altered contour suggesting previous trauma or degenerative changes. The alignment of the scapula and the acromioclavicular joint appears preserved, but there may be associated soft tissue swelling or joint effusion that is not clearly defined in this imaging.
