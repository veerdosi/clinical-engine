The X-ray image reveals a right forearm with a fracture in both the radius and ulna. The fracture appears to be transverse, showcasing a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity, as well as significant soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site. There is also evidence of potential angulation or malalignment of the fracture segments, which may indicate instability of the bone structure.
