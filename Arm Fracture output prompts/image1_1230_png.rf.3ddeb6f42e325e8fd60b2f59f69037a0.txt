The X-ray demonstrates the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, revealing a possible humeral head deformity characterized by irregular contours. There is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, which may indicate potential rotator cuff pathology or impingement. Additionally, the acromion shows signs of degenerative changes, suggesting osteoarthritis that may contribute to shoulder pain and limited range of motion.
