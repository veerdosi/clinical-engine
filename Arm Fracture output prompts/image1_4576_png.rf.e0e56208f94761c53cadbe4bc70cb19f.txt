The radiographic image displays three views of the right hand, allowing for assessment of the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. A notable finding is the presence of a possible malalignment in the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may indicate a deformity such as a fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction in the metacarpals that could suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma.
