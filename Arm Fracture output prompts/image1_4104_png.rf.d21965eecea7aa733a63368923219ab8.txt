The X-ray image demonstrates a deformity associated with a fracture in one of the phalanges of the hand, which is stabilized by an intramedullary screw fixation. The presence of callus formation is noted around the fracture site, indicating a healing response to the bony injury. Furthermore, the alignment of the phalanx appears to be compromised, suggesting potential malunion or improper healing of the fracture.
