The X-ray image displays the left wrist and hand, including the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. There is an evident fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical outline, along with potential displacement that may indicate instability. Additionally, signs of joint effusion may be noted, suggesting the possibility of associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
