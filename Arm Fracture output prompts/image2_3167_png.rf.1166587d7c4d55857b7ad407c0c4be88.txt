The X-ray image displayed is of the right shoulder, showing the glenohumeral joint and associated anatomical structures. There is evidence of a humeral head deformity, with potential changes indicative of osteoarthritis or possible avascular necrosis. The joint space appears narrowed, which may suggest degenerative changes or an effusion, necessitating further clinical correlation for a definitive diagnosis.
