The X-ray image demonstrates a left forearm, revealing a notable angular deformity of the ulna. There appears to be a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity, indicative of a possible fracture, with accompanying periosteal reaction observed. Additionally, the alignment of the distal joint surfaces suggests potential instability or malunion of the involved structures.
