The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint in a slightly oblique view, demonstrating the humeral, radial, and ulnar articulations. A notable displacement at the site of the distal humerus is observed, potentially indicating an acute fracture or malalignment. Additionally, there is an effusion in the joint space, which suggests the presence of intra-articular fluid accumulation, possibly due to trauma or inflammatory processes.
