The X-ray image reveals a proximal humeral fracture with displacement observed in a right shoulder view. There is visible disruption of the humeral head and neck proximal to the surgical neck, indicating potential involvement of the axillary nerve. Additionally, the greater tuberosity appears to be fragmented, raising concerns for a rotator cuff tear associated with the fracture.
