The X-ray image displays the left humerus in a lateral view, highlighting the intricate anatomy of the proximal and distal segments of the bone. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft diaphyseal fracture, characterized by a complete disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, accompanied by possible displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site may suggest an associated hematoma or ligamentous injury, warranting further evaluation.
