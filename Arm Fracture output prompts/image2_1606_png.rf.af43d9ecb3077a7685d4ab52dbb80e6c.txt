The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right elbow and proximal forearm, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an angulation of the ulnar diaphysis, suggesting a possible deformity or malalignment of the bone structure. Additionally, the radiographic appearance indicates a potential fracture or stress injury in the distal radius, which may warrant further investigation for underlying pathology.
