The X-ray image demonstrates the shoulder region, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and the surrounding osseous structures. A noticeable deformity is observed at the proximal humerus, where there appears to be a disruption suggestive of a possible humeral head fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of localized cortical irregularity around the joint, which may indicate the presence of degenerative changes or osteoarthritis affecting the surrounding structures.
