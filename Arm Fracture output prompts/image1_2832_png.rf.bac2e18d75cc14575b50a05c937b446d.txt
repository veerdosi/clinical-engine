The X-ray image depicts the left elbow joint, showing the presence of an internal fixation device, likely indicative of a previous surgical intervention. The humeral and ulnar structures are visualized, with no acute fracture lines apparent; however, the surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema, which can be consistent with post-operative changes. Additionally, there is a possible alignment issue with the joint surfaces, suggesting potential complications such as malunion or nonunion that may require further evaluation.
