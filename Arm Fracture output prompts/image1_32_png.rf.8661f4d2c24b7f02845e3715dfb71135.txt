The X-ray image depicts the left upper extremity, specifically highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is evidence of cortical bone disruption indicative of a possible fracture, particularly in the mid-shaft region of the radius. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed, which may suggest accompanying hematoma formation or inflammation surrounding the affected area.
