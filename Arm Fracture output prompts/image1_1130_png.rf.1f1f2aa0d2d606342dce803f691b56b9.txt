The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right wrist joint, displaying the carpal bones and their articulations. Notable findings include the presence of a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity, which may indicate acute trauma. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joint, suggesting potential associated ligamentous injury or contusion in the area.
