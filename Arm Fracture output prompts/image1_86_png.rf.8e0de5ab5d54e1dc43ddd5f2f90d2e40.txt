The X-ray image demonstrates a forearm with clear visibility of the radius and ulna bones. There is an apparent fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and potential angulation. Additionally, there is evidence of a concomitant fracture in the distal ulna, suggesting an injury pattern consistent with forearm trauma.
