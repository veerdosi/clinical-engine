The X-ray image displays the wrist joint, highlighting both the carpal and distal radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of potential osseous pathology observed through irregularities in the joint space or morphology of the carpal bones, possibly indicating conditions such as osteoarthritis or a fracture. Soft tissue shadowing may suggest associated edema or signs of joint effusion in the area surrounding the wrist joint.
