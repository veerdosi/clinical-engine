The X-ray image displays a right forearm, revealing a fracture through the diaphysis of the radius. The radial cortex exhibits a disruption indicative of a significant bone injury, consistent with either a transverse or oblique fracture pattern. Surrounding the fracture site, there is moderate periosteal reaction, suggesting a healing response to the injury.
