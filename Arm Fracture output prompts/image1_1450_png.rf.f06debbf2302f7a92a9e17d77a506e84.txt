The X-ray image reveals the right forearm, showing the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there may be signs of cortical thickening in the region, which can indicate an underlying pathology such as osteogenic processes or prior injury.
