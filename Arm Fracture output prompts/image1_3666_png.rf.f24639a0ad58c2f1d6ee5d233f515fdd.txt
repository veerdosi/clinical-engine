The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the hand, clearly depicting the metacarpal bones and phalanges. There is evidence of a possible fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone contour and localized soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there appears to be a slight misalignment of the phalanx, suggesting a potential dislocation or angulation deformity associated with the fracture.
