The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, highlighting the humeral head and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is a notable presence of a Hill-Sachs lesion, which is indicative of a previous anterior shoulder dislocation, characterized by a compression fracture of the posterior lateral aspect of the humeral head. Additionally, there may be signs of subacromial impingement, as suggested by the spatial relationship between the humerus and the acromion process.
