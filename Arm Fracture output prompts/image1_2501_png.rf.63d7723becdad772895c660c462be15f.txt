The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, specifically showing the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. A notable finding is the potential presence of a proximal humeral fracture, which can be characterized by displacement or angulation of the humeral head. Additionally, the acromioclavicular joint appears to be intact, while signs of osteoarthritis may be inferred from any narrowing of joint spaces or subchondral sclerosis, although these findings would require further evaluation for confirmation.
