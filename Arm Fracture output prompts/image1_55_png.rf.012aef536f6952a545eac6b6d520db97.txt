The X-ray image presents two views of the left arm, demonstrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone and associated periosteal reaction. Additionally, the proximal ulna exhibits signs of a potential osteophyte formation, indicating possible underlying degenerative changes or chronic stress.

The soft tissue surrounding the fracture site shows increased density, suggestive of edema or hematoma formation. The alignment of the bones appears compromised, further supporting the presence of traumatic injury. There are also subtle signs of arthritic changes evident in the joints, particularly at the wrist, characterized by joint space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation.
