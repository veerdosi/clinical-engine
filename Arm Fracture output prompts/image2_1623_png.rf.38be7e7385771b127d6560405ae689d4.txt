The radiograph depicts the left forearm, showcasing a post-reduction view of the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a recent fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a loss of continuity of the cortical bone, suggesting a possible dorsal angulation. The alignment of the bones appears to be restored following reduction, with no significant malunion observed at this stage.
