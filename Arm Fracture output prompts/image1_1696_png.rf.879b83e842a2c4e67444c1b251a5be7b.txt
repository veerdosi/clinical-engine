The X-ray image displays the left humerus and forearm bones, clearly indicating the anatomical structures of the radius and ulna. Noteworthy is the presence of a non-displaced fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a break in cortical integrity without angulation. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no signs of edema or hematoma evident in this view.
