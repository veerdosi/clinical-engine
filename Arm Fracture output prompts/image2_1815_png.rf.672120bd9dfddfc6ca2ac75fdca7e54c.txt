The X-ray image displays a right forearm with an apparent diaphyseal fracture of the radius and ulna, characterized by irregularity at the fracture line. There are notable signs of cortical disruption and possible displacement of the bone fragments, indicating a complete fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the fracture site, which could suggest an associated hematoma or contusion.
