The X-ray image displays the left forearm, including the radius and ulna, in both anterior-posterior and lateral views. Notable in the image is a mid-shaft transverse fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the bone continuity, with associated soft tissue swelling evident in the surrounding area. Additionally, there is potential involvement of the distal radioulnar joint, which may indicate complications such as instability or malalignment, warranting further clinical evaluation.
