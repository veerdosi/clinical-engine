The image presents an anteroposterior radiograph of the humerus and forearm, illustrating the anatomical relationship between the elbow joint and adjacent structures. Notable is the presence of a significant angular deformity in the distal humerus, suggestive of possible malalignment or fracture-related changes. Additionally, periarticular soft tissue swelling may be observed, indicative of inflammation or hematoma formation associated with underlying joint pathology.
