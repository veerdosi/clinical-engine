The X-ray image presents a view of the left shoulder, including the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notable in this image is a potential proximal humeral fracture, which may be indicated by irregular alignment or cortical disruption of the humeral head. Additionally, there is a possibility of soft tissue swelling around the shoulder joint, which can be suggestive of associated hematoma or inflammatory changes.
