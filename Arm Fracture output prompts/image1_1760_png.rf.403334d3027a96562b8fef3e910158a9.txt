The X-ray image depicts the left wrist and part of the forearm, showing the distal radius and ulna. There is an observable fracture of the distal radius near the wrist joint, characterized by a significant angulation, which may indicate a complicated fracture pattern. Additionally, signs of joint effusion or possible injury to the carpal bones are evident, warranting further evaluation for associated ligamentous injury or complications.
