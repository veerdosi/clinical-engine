The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture in the proximal phalanx of the finger, evidenced by a visible fracture line and malalignment of the cortical bone. There is the presence of intraosseous fixation hardware, likely indicative of previous surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, suggesting potential inflammation or post-surgical changes in the region.
