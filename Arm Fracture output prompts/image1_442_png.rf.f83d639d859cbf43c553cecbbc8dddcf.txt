The image illustrates an x-ray of the left forearm, displaying the radius and ulna bones. There is a notable area of cortical disruption along the diaphysis of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, suggesting potential malalignment or angulation at the fracture site.
