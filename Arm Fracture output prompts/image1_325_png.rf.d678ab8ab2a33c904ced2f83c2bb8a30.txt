The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the forearm, revealing an oblique fracture of the radius with significant displacement. There is notable soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating potential hematoma formation or effusion. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears intact, suggesting that this is a unilateral injury without associated injuries to the adjacent ulnar bone.
