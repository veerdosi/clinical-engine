The X-ray image depicts the left humerus and scapula, illustrating a potential fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, which is characterized by discontinuity in the cortical bone. Additionally, there is an observable displacement of the proximal humeral segment, consistent with a possible humeral head avulsion. Surrounding soft tissues show signs of edema, though no calcifications or foreign bodies are evident within the field of view.
