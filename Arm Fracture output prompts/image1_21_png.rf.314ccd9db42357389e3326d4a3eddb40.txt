The X-ray image depicts the left wrist and hand, showing all carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, suggesting possible osteoarthritis affecting the carpometacarpal joint, particularly at the base of the first metacarpal. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may indicate inflammation or traumatic injury in the surrounding structures.
