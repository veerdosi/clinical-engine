The X-ray image reveals an acute fracture of the distal humerus, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Notably, there is an associated misalignment at the elbow joint, indicating potential displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the fracture site, suggestive of hematoma formation or edema.
