The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the right forearm, including the radius and ulna. There is a notable fracture of the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity and resultant displacement of the distal fragment. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, indicating possible associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
