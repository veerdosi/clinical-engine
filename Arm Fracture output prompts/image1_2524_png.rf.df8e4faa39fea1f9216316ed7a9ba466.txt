The X-ray image presents a view of the wrist and hand, illustrating a significant deformity characterized by a loss of normal anatomical alignment in the carpal and metacarpal regions. Notably, there is an intramuscular fixation device, which indicates a history of surgical intervention, likely related to a fracture of the distal radius or a similar injury. Additionally, there may be signs of callus formation around the surgical site, suggesting a healing response in bone tissue following the initial insult.
