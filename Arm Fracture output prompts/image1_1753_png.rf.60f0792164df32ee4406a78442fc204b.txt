The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of the left hand, emphasizing the phalanges and metacarpal bones. There is an observable angulation at the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger, indicative of possible malalignment or a deformity. The overall bone density appears within normal limits; however, the alignment issues suggest the potential presence of a condition such as a boutonniere deformity or other soft tissue complications affecting joint mechanics.
