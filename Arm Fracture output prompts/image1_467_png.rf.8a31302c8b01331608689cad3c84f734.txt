The x-ray image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia, with a notable presence of joint effusion in the knee joint space, indicative of potential inflammatory or traumatic pathology. There is also evidence of cortical irregularity along the lateral aspect of the distal femur, which may suggest a chondral defect or an associated fracture. Additionally, mild osteophyte formation is observed around the joint margins, pointing towards early signs of osteoarthritis.
