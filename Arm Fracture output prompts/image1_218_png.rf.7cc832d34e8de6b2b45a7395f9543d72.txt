The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, revealing a potential glenohumeral joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency surrounding the humeral head. There is evidence of subchondral sclerosis and possible osteophyte formation at the glenoid and humeral head, suggestive of degenerative joint disease, often referred to as osteoarthritis. Additionally, the positioning of the humeral head and greater tuberosity raises suspicion for a rotator cuff pathology.
