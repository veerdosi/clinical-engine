The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a subluxation at the proximal interphalangeal joint, with displacement of the middle phalanx. Additionally, signs of potential osteolysis are visible around the periarticular regions, suggesting possible inflammatory or degenerative changes.
