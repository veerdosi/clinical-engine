The X-ray image displays a right shoulder showing an orthopedic implant, indicative of a total shoulder arthroplasty. The humeral component appears well-positioned within the humeral canal, suggesting successful fixation without signs of loosening. The surrounding soft tissues show no visible signs of inflammation or complications, although the postoperative status indicates the area is in a recovery phase.
