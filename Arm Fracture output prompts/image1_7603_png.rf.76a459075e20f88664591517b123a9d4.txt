The X-ray image provided displays the right shoulder joint in a lateral view, allowing for assessment of the glenohumeral joint and associated structures. There is evidence of osteophyte formation at the acromioclavicular joint, suggestive of possible osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is a radiolucent area noted in the proximal humerus, which may indicate the presence of a cystic lesion or other pathological processes requiring further evaluation.
