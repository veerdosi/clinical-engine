The X-ray image reveals the presence of a fractured proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by cortical disruption and a noticeable angulation at the fracture site. There is also evidence of surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may suggest associated hematoma formation. No significant displacement is noted, indicating a potential stable fracture pattern.
