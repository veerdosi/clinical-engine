The X-ray image reveals a surgically implanted total knee prosthesis, indicative of a prior arthroplasty procedure. There is visible alteration of the normal bony anatomy, particularly at the femoral and tibial interfaces, suggesting significant degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis prior to the intervention. Additionally, the alignment and positioning of the prosthesis are critical for biomechanical stability, and any malalignment could potentially lead to complications, such as periprosthetic fracture or implant failure.
