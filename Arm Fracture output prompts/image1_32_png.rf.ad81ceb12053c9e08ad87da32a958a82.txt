The X-ray illustrates a left upper extremity, focusing on the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a possible fracture line observed in the mid-shaft of the radius, which may indicate acute injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is present around the elbow joint, suggesting potential joint effusion or hematoma formation.
