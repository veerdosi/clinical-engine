The X-ray image depicts an orthopedic implant, specifically a plate with fixation screws, applied to the distal aspect of the forearm. There is evidence of a fracture line through the radius, suggesting a recent or chronic fracture in the region that has been stabilized surgically. Surrounding the implant, there may be an absence of callus formation indicating potential complications such as non-union or delayed healing associated with the fracture site.
