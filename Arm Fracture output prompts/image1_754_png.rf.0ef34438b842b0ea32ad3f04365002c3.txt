The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the left shoulder, demonstrating a potential humeral head deformity with an irregularity in the contour. There is evidence of subluxation characterized by the displacement of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue may show edema, indicating the presence of inflammation, which could be associated with a rotator cuff pathology.
