The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormality in the right shoulder joint, particularly in the acromioclavicular (AC) joint region. There appears to be a degree of acromioclavicular degeneration or possible separation indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by irregular joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. Additionally, there's observed subacromial impingement, which may contribute to limited range of motion or shoulder pain.
