The X-ray reveals an anteroposterior view of the left humerus, displaying a notable diaphyseal fracture with signs of displacement. There is evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, indicating possible contusion or injury to the adjacent musculature. Additionally, the proximal and distal articulations appear intact, with no visible joint effusions or signs of arthritic changes in the glenohumeral and elbow joints.
