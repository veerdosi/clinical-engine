The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint and upper arm, illustrating the proximal humerus. There appears to be evidence of a potential proximal humeral fracture, characterized by misalignment and displacement of the bone segments. Additionally, soft tissue edema may be observed surrounding the joint, indicative of a possible inflammatory response or injury.
