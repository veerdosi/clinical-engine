The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the humerus and forearm, revealing a significant angular deformity at the mid-shaft of the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture across the diaphysis of the radius, characterized by a sharp disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there appears to be associated soft tissue edema around the fracture site, which may indicate an inflammatory response.
