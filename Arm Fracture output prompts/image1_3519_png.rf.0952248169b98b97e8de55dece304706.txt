The X-ray image shows a right elbow joint with evidence of surgical intervention, indicated by the presence of metallic fixation devices, likely plates or screws. There is a notable alignment of the ulnar and radial bones, suggesting a previous fracture that has undergone surgical stabilization. Additionally, periosteal reaction or changes in cortical thickness may be observed, which could indicate prior trauma or pathological conditions affecting the osseous structures.
