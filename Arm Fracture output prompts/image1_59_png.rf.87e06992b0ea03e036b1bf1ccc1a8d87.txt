The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, particularly focusing on the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible radiolucent line indicating a possible fracture in the mid-shaft region of the radius, which may suggest disruption to the cortex. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction evident along the affected area, which may reflect underlying trauma or inflammation.
