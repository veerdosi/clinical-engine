The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint in a lateral view, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula. Joint space narrowing is observed, suggesting possible osteoarthritis, characterized by degenerative changes in the articular cartilage. Additionally, subchondral sclerosis can be noted in the tibial plateau, indicating chronic stress and abnormal loading on the joint surfaces.
