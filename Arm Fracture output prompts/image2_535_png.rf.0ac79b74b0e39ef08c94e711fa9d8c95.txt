The X-ray image reveals an anterior view of the right elbow joint, demonstrating a post-surgical alignment of components indicative of a total elbow arthroplasty, characterized by the presence of a metallic prosthesis. There is also visual evidence of potential osteolysis around the prosthetic surfaces and a notable decrease in the normal joint space, suggesting degenerative changes or inflammatory processes in the surrounding osseous structures. Additionally, irregularities in the cortical bone can be observed, which may indicate stress or strain responses associated with altered biomechanical forces following the surgical intervention.
