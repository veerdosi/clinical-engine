The image shows a lateral radiograph of the left wrist and distal forearm, revealing a fixation plate and associated screws within the radius, suggesting prior surgical intervention. There is evidence of an intra-articular fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a misalignment of the distal radioulnar joint. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling may be noted around the distal forearm, indicating potential post-operative changes or residual effects from the initial injury.
