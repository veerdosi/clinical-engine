The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the wrist and hand, presenting with a potential fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity and possible angulation. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling in adjacent areas, which could indicate underlying edema or hematoma formation. Additionally, alignment of the carpal bones and metacarpals appears compromised, suggesting instability or malposition that may warrant further evaluation for associated collateral ligament injury.
