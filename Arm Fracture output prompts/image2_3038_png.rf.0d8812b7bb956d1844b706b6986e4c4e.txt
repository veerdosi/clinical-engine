The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, demonstrating an orthopedic fixation device, likely a plate and screws system, applied to the proximal humerus. There is evidence of a prior fracture in the humeral head region, with the fixation hardware indicating previous surgical intervention for stabilization. Surrounding the surgical site, slight cortical irregularity may suggest the presence of postoperative changes or soft tissue involvement.
