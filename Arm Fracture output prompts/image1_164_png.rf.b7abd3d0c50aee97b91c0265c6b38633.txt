The X-ray depicts a right leg, specifically illustrating both the femur and tibia, with notable attention to the patella. The presence of a linear fracture is observed in the mid-shaft of the tibia, characterized by a distinct break in cortical continuity. Additionally, there may be signs of periosteal reaction adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting an acute injury with possible associated soft tissue edema.
