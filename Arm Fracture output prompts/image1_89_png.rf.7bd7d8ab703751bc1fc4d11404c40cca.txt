The X-ray depicts an oblique view of the right hand, illustrating the individual phalanges of the fingers. Notably, there is a pronounced deformity at the second digit (index finger), characterized by a malalignment and possible angulation, which may suggest a history of trauma or a congenital abnormality. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear intact, without evidence of significant edema or osseous lesions, but further evaluation may be warranted to assess for any underlying fractures or joint pathologies.
