The X-ray image displays a left femur in an anteroposterior view, characterized by a notable deformity in the mid-shaft region. There is evidence of a cortical disruption suggesting a possible fracture, with adjacent soft tissue swelling that may indicate a hematoma formation. Additionally, the alignment of the femur appears compromised, potentially indicative of malunion or nonunion in the presence of a significant fracture.
