The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left forearm, illustrating the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a clear mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by disruption of the cortices and a possible displacement. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest an associated hematoma or inflammation.
