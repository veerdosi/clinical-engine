The X-ray image demonstrates a clear view of the wrist and hand, emphasizing both the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is notable angulation in the distal radius, which may indicate a potential fracture or deformity, commonly referred to as a distal radius fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the phalanges appears intact, but there may be evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the carpal area, suggestive of tenosynovitis or another inflammatory condition.
