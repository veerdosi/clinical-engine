The X-ray image displays a right forearm demonstrating a fracture in the distal radius, which is evident by a transverse break with displacement. There is also the presence of internal fixation hardware, indicative of a surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture site. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no signs of acute edema or additional bony abnormalities noted.
