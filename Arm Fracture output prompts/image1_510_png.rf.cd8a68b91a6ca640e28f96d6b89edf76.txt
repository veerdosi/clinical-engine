The X-ray demonstrates the right wrist and distal forearm, revealing a clear view of the carpal bones and part of the radius and ulna. There is a notable fracture observed in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity, which may suggest a Colles' fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident around the fracture site, indicating associated acute inflammatory changes in the surrounding musculature.
