The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, which includes the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella. Notably, there appears to be irregularities in the joint space, suggesting potential degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, attention should be paid to the presence of any osteophytes, which can indicate a former injury or chronic joint stress.
