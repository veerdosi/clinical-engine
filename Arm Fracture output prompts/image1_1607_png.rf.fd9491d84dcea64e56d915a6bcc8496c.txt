The X-ray image reveals the right wrist joint, showing articulation between the distal radius and the proximal carpal bones. Notably, there appears to be an irregularity in the joint space, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritic changes characterized by joint spacing narrowing or subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are signs of possible inflammatory conditions, indicated by effusion in the joint space and potential osteophyte formation around the articular surfaces.
