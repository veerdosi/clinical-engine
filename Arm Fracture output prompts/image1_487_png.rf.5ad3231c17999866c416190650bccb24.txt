The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint in a lateral view, highlighting the humerus, ulna, and radius. Notable findings include the presence of a potential effusion within the olecranon bursa, as indicated by soft tissue swelling around the elbow joint. Additionally, there may be degenerative changes or osteophyte formation at the olecranon process, suggestive of possible elbow osteoarthritis.
