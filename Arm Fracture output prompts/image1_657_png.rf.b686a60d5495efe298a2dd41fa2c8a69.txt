The X-ray image depicts a left knee joint with a fixation device present, indicating a surgical intervention. There is a notable presence of a metallic plate and screws, suggesting a probable osteosynthesis procedure performed to stabilize a fracture. The alignment of the femur and tibia appears to be maintained, although the surrounding soft tissues are not visible in this radiographic representation.
