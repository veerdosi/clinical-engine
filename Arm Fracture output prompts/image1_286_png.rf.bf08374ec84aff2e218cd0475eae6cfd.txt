The X-ray image reveals acute changes in the right knee joint, particularly highlighting the femur and tibia. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture at the proximal tibia, distinct in its alignment and cortical disruption. Additionally, slight joint effusion may be suggested by the increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, indicating potential underlying hemorrhage or synovitis.
