The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow, revealing significant signs of joint effusion and potential subluxation of the radius and ulna. Notable osseous changes are present, including periosteal reaction and possible osteophyte formation, indicating degenerative joint disease, commonly referred to as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be evidence of a fractured radial head, which is typically characterized by an irregularity in the cortical bone continuity, raising concerns for associated complications.
