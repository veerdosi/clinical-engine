The X-ray image displays the left forearm, specifically illustrating both the radius and ulna. Noteworthy is the presence of an angular deformity at the midshaft of the ulna, indicating potential previous trauma or a pathological condition. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction, suggesting a possible osteogenic process or an inflammatory response in the surrounding soft tissues.
