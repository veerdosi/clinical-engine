The X-ray image illustrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing a significant degree of joint effusion indicated by the lucency surrounding the olecranon process. There is evidence of possible osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, suggesting the presence of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, a subtle periosteal reaction is noted along the lateral aspect of the radius, which may be indicative of a chronic inflammatory process or mechanical stress.
