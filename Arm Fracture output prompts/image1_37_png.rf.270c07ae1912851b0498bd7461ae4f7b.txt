The x-ray image illustrates the right forearm, including the radius and ulna, with well-defined diaphyseal cortices. There is evidence of a transverse fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex. The ulna appears intact, but there may be associated soft tissue swelling noted in the surrounding regions, indicative of a potential hematoma or inflammatory reaction.
