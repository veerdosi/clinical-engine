The X-ray image illustrates the skeletal structure of the left wrist, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by an irregularity in the cortical outline and possible displacement of fragments. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, which may suggest associated contusion or inflammation.
