The X-ray image reveals the right knee joint in a standard anteroposterior view, showing alignment of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable are the outlined bony structures, with particular attention to the presence of joint space narrowing, which may suggest degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there are signs of potential effusion, indicated by the obscured fat pads around the knee joint, which could be indicative of underlying joint pathology.
