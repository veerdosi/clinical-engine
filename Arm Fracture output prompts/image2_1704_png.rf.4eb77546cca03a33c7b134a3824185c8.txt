The image depicts a radiographic view of the left forearm, specifically illustrating the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a potential fracture evident at the distal aspect of the radius, characterized by a visible fracture line and displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, there is an accumulation of subcutaneous soft tissue swelling proximal to the fracture site, indicative of associated soft tissue injury or contusion.
