The X-ray depicts the left humerus demonstrating the presence of an orthopedic fixation device, likely a plate and screws, indicating prior surgical intervention. There is visible osteosynthesis across the diaphysis, with signs of callus formation suggesting a healing process, which could be indicative of a previous fracture. The alignment of the bony cortex appears satisfactory around the hardware, and no acute complications such as screw loosening or fracture non-union are observed in this image.
