The X-ray image displays an adult forearm with the presence of an external fixation device along the ulna and radius, indicative of a recent or post-surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Notably, there is evidence of a comminuted fracture in the mid-shaft region of both the radius and ulna, characterized by multiple fracture fragments. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, without any visible signs of calcifications or other pathological changes.
