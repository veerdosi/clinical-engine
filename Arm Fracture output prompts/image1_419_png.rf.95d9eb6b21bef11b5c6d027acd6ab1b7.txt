The X-ray image demonstrates the left arm in a flexed position, with a clear view of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is a significant angulation seen at the midshaft of the radius, which may suggest a possible fracture or deformity in the bone structure. Additionally, the joint spaces appear intact, indicating no displaced fragments at the elbow or wrist articulations.
