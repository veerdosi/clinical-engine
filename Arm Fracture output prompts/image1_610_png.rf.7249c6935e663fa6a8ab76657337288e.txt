The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notably, there is an evident fracture line crossing through the shaft of the radius, indicative of a possible distal radius fracture. Additionally, signs of effusion may be observed in the joint space, suggesting the presence of fluid accumulation possibly associated with trauma or injury.
