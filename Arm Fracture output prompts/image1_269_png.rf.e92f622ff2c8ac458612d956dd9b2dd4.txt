The image displays a lateral X-ray view of the right hand, focusing on the thumb and the associated carpometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints. There is a prominent alignment of the phalanges, indicating potential deviation or misalignment that may suggest a condition such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints. Notably, there are signs of possible joint effusion or bony irregularities at the bases of the proximal phalanx, which may indicate underlying pathology warranting further clinical evaluation.
