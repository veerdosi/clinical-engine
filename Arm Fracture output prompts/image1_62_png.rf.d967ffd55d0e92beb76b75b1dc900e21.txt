The X-ray image depicts the right hand, specifically highlighting the phalangeal bones and the metacarpals. Notable findings include a possible malalignment or angular deviation of the proximal phalanx, which may suggest a deformity such as a bunion or other structural abnormality. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the first digit, which could indicate an inflammatory process or soft tissue injury associated with underlying bony pathology.
