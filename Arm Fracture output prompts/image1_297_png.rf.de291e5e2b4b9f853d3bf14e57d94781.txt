The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, with an emphasized focus on the carpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. Additionally, indications of joint effusion may be observed in the wrist joint, suggesting inflammatory changes or potential trauma-related complications.
