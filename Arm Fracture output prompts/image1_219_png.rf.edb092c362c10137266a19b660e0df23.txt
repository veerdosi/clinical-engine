The X-ray image displayed is a right lateral view of the humerus. There is evidence of a transverse fracture in the midshaft of the humerus, characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there may be signs of an accompanying hematoma in the surrounding soft tissues, indicating potential bleeding associated with the fracture.
