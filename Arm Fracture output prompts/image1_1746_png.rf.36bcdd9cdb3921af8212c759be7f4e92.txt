The X-ray demonstrates a left shoulder joint with notable joint space narrowing, which may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. There is a presence of subchondral sclerosis and possible osteophyte formation along the glenohumeral joint, reflecting chronic stress on the cartilage. Additionally, the humeral head exhibits irregular contour, raising suspicion for potential rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
