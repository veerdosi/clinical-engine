The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the ulna and radius in relation to the humerus. There is a notable deformity characterized by abnormal joint alignment and potential joint effusion, indicative of an underlying inflammatory process such as bursitis or synovitis. Furthermore, the presence of osteophytes along the joint margins suggests the possibility of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis), warranting further clinical correlation and evaluation.
