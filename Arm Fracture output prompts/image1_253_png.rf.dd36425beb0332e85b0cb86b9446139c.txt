The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing a potential anterior displacement of the radial head. There is evidence of joint effusion, which may indicate underlying pathology such as synovitis or trauma. No acute fractures are visible in the surrounding bony structures, but slight irregularities in the bone contour may suggest prior osteopathic changes or degenerative joint disease.
