The X-ray image presents a left shoulder joint, revealing the humeral head and scapular structures. Notable within the image is the presence of degenerative changes consistent with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there appears to be an irregularity at the humeral head contour, suggestive of potential rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
