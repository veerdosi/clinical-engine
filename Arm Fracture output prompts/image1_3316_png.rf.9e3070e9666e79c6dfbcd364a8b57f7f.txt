The X-ray image demonstrates the left hand, revealing the bony structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing in the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, which may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be slight cortical irregularity in one of the proximal phalanges, which could suggest a possible history of trauma or stress-related changes.
