The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the humeral head and proximal humerus, revealing potential signs of a glenohumeral joint pathology. Notably, there appears to be subluxation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid fossa, which may suggest instability in the joint structure. Additionally, the presence of bony irregularities or osteophytes in the region of the acromioclavicular joint could indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
