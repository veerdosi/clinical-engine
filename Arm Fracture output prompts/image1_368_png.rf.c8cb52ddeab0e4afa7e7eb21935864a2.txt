The X-ray image depicts the wrist and distal forearm of a patient, revealing distinct anatomical alignment of the carpal bones and radioulnar joint. There are signs of joint effusion and potential soft tissue swelling around the wrist, indicating possible inflammatory or traumatic processes. Notably, there appears to be a deviation in the alignment of the distal radius, which may suggest malunion or possible instabilities of the wrist joint complex.
