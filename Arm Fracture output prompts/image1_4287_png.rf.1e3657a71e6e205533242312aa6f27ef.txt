The X-ray image reveals a possible acromioclavicular joint separation at the shoulder, indicated by the displacement of the clavicle relative to the acromion process of the scapula. The surrounding soft tissue appears to show signs of edema, suggesting an inflammatory response, which may indicate an underlying injury or degenerative condition. Additionally, the contour of the greater tuberosity of the humerus is observable, and any changes in its morphology could suggest rotator cuff pathology.
