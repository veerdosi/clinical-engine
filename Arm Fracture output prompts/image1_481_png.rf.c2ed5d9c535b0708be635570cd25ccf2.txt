The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the right forearm, revealing the distal radius and ulna. There is an apparent angulation in the distal radius, indicative of a possible fracture, specifically a distal radius fracture, which is commonly associated with wrist injuries. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no signs of edema or other acute pathological changes noted in this view.
