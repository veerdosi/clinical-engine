The image presents an X-ray of the left arm, specifically highlighting the humerus and adjacent joints. There is evidence of cortical bone irregularities associated with a possible fracture or osteolytic lesion, indicated by an area of radiolucency disrupting the normal bone density. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion at the elbow joint, which could suggest inflammation or trauma to the surrounding soft tissues.
