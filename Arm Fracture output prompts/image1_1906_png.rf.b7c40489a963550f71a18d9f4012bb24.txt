The X-ray image displays a post-operative condition of the distal radius, characterized by the presence of a plate and screws, indicating stabilization following a fracture. Notable is the alignment of the radius and the absence of significant displacement, suggesting effective surgical intervention for the fracture management. There is also a soft tissue shadow at the wrist joint, which may indicate edema or healing tissue in the surrounding area.
