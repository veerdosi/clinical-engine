The X-ray image presents a clear view of the right forearm, demonstrating both the radius and ulna. There is notable cortical disruption and radiolucency indicative of a possible fracture or osseous pathology in the radial region. Additionally, the alignment of the wrist joint appears normal, suggesting that the injury may be confined to the mid-shaft of the radius without associated dislocation at the distal radioulnar joint.
