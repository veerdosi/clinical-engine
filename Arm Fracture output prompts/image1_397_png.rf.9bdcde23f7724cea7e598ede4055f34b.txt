The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right shoulder and upper arm, revealing the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notable observations include a potential fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, characterized by a disruption in the bony cortex and possible displacement of fragments. Additionally, there may be signs of subacromial impingement, indicated by the narrowing of the subacromial space and potential bony spurs on the acromion process.
