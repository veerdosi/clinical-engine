The image displays an X-ray of a human hand, focusing on the metacarpals and phalanges. There is evidence of moderate osteopenia indicated by decreased bone density and cortical thickness, which may suggest underlying metabolic bone disease. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing in the proximal interphalangeal joints, potentially indicative of early osteoarthritis.
