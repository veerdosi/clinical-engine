The X-ray image displays the right humerus in an anteroposterior view, revealing the bone's cortical along with the surrounding soft tissue. Notably, there is an observable disruption in continuity at the midshaft of the humerus, suggestive of a possible fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction, which may indicate underlying stress or pathology in the adjacent bone structure.
