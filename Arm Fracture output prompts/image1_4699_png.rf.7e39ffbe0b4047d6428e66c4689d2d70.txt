The X-ray image shows the right hand in a dorsopalmar view, highlighting the phalangeal bones of the fingers. Notably, there is an angulation deformity involving the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, suggestive of a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the digit appears edematous, which may indicate a reactive process associated with trauma or inflammation.
