The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the left wrist and forearm, illustrating potential signs of osteopenia, characterized by reduced bone density. There is also evidence of a deformity, likely indicated by angulation at the distal radius, suggesting a possible malalignment of the radial structure. Furthermore, the presence of joint space narrowing at the distal radioulnar joint may suggest degenerative changes or inflammatory conditions affecting the joint architecture.
