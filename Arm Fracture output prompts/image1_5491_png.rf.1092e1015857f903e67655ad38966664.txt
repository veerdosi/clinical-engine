The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the shoulder joint, prominently showing the glenohumeral articulation. There is evidence of an acromioclavicular joint separation characterized by a displacement of the distal clavicle in relation to the acromion process. Additionally, there is a noticeable irregularity in the bony architecture, which may suggest a potential rotator cuff tear or related pathology involving the surrounding soft tissues.
