The X-ray image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia at the knee joint, highlighting the presence of orthopedic hardware, which suggests prior surgical intervention. There are signs of osteosclerosis adjacent to the metal fixation devices, indicating potential bone remodeling or response to stress at the surgical site. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, which may be indicative of degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis, impacting the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia.
