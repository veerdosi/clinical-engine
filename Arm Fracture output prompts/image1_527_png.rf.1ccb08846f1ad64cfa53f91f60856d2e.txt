The X-ray image shows the left wrist joint and the distal forearm, revealing an apparent fracture of the distal radius characterized by a notable cortical disruption and displacement. Additionally, there is increased radiolucency observed around the fracture site, suggesting possible edema or soft tissue involvement associated with the injury. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no signs of dislocation or significant degenerative changes noted in the surrounding joint structures.
