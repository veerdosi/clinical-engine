The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, with clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, the lateral aspect exhibits a slight misalignment of the patella, indicative of possible patellar dislocation or maltracking, warranting further clinical evaluation.
