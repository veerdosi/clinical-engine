The X-ray image displays the knee joint in a coronal view, revealing the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and patella. Notable is the presence of joint effusion, characterized by an increased radiolucency surrounding the knee joint, which may suggest underlying synovitis or inflammatory pathology. Additionally, alignment appears within normal limits, but subtle changes in bone density in the proximal tibia raise suspicion for possible osteopenia.
