The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint, revealing a significant joint effusion, which appears as a radiolucent area around the articulating surfaces. Notably, there is evidence of osteophyte formation along the joint margins, suggestive of degenerative joint disease, commonly known as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is a potential fracture line visible in the distal humerus, which warrants further evaluation for completeness and to assess for any associated complications.
