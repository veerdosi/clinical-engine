The X-ray image demonstrates the left wrist and hand, showing the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna. There is a notable presence of joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation at the radiocarpal joint, suggestive of degenerative changes. Additionally, there may be signs of a fracture or malalignment, particularly in the area of the distal radius, which could indicate trauma or osteoporotic changes.
