The radiograph displays an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone integrity. Notably, there is a moderate amount of callus formation indicative of a healing response surrounding the fracture site. Additionally, the alignment of the distal ulna appears to be within normal limits, without signs of associated ligamentous injury or dislocation.
