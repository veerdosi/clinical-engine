The image depicts a lateral X-ray view of the left elbow joint, clearly showing the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Signs of potential olecranon prominence may be noted in conjunction with a visible joint effusion, which could indicate underlying inflammatory processes or trauma. Increased radiolucency in the surrounding soft tissues may suggest edema or other pathological changes consistent with injury or degenerative conditions affecting the elbow.
