The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the humerus, forearm, and elbow joint, revealing a significant angular deformity in the distal segment of the radius. There is evidence of an abnormal alignment at the elbow joint with potential joint space widening, suggestive of a possible dislocation or severe fracture. Additionally, the opacity and irregularities in bone cortex may indicate underlying osteopenia or an acute fracture, warranting further investigation for specific pathological conditions.
