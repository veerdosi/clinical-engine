The X-ray image displays a left hand in a partially flexed position, highlighting an angular deformity in the distal phalanx of the index finger. There is a visible fracture in the proximal phalanx, characterized by malalignment and cortical disruption indicative of a recent traumatic event. Additionally, there is evidence of an internal fixation device, suggesting surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture and maintain proper alignment during the healing process.
