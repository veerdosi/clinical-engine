The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius, evident by the disruption in the cortical continuity of the bone. Notably, internal fixation hardware is visible, indicating that stabilization of the fracture has been achieved through surgical intervention. There is an absence of significant soft tissue swelling or other acute lesions surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest a well-maintained post-operative status.
