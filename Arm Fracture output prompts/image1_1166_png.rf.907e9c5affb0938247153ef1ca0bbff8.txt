The X-ray image indicates a prominent angular deformity in the ulna, suggestive of a potential valgus or varus alignment issue at the elbow joint. There is evidence of joint effusion at the elbow, with increased radiolucency surrounding the joint space, which may indicate an accumulation of synovial fluid. Additionally, the radiographic features reveal subchondral sclerosis beneath the articular surface, potentially suggestive of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint changes.
