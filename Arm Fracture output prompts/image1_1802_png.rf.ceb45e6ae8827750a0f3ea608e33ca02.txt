The x-ray reveals a lateral view of the hand with a focus on the phalangeal bones of the fourth finger. Notably, there is a well-defined oval radiolucency located in the distal phalanx, which may suggest the presence of a subungual exostosis or soft tissue lesion. Additionally, there appears to be some irregularity or alterations in the contour of the underlying bony structures, warranting further evaluation for possible underlying pathology, such as an osteochondroma or other bone lesion.
