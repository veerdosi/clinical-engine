The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left forearm, showcasing both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a transverse fracture located in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a clear disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears to be intact, indicating no evident dislocation or distal fracture at this time.
