The radiograph demonstrates the skeletal structure of the right hand, highlighting the phalanges, metacarpals, and distal forearm bones. Notable is the presence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, which may indicate a fracture-dislocation pattern in the wrist joint. Additionally, there are signs of possible degenerative changes at the carpometacarpal joint, suggesting the early stages of osteoarthritis.
