The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right hand, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable findings include a potential fracture of the distal radius, characterized by localized cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the alignment of the carpometacarpal joints appears compromised, suggestive of possible ligamentous injury or instability.
