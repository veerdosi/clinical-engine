The X-ray image displays the right hand in a partially flexed position, with clear visualization of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a notable angulation in the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger, suggesting the presence of a possible malalignment or deformity. Furthermore, there may be signs of a fracture or dislocation, particularly at the base of the proximal phalanx, indicated by irregularities in the bone contour.
