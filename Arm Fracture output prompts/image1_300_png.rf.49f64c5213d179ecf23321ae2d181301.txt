The X-ray image reveals a series of views of the left wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalangeal joints. Notably, there is a significant deformity in the distal radius, characterized by a fracture that appears displaced, indicating a possible distal radius fracture. Additionally, the phalangeal alignment suggests some degree of malalignment, which may point towards traumatic injury or a potential degenerative condition affecting joint integrity.
