The image demonstrates a lateral radiographic view of the knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is notable narrowing of the joint space, suggestive of osteoarthritis, which can be characterized by degenerative changes observed in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Additionally, there may be evidence of periarticular osteophyte formation, commonly associated with chronic joint degeneration.
