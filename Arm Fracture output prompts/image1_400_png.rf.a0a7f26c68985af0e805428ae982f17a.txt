The X-ray image displays the right hand in an anteroposterior projection, clearly showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable findings include a potential fracture line in the distal radius, which may indicate a traumatic injury, as well as signs of joint effusion around the carpometacarpal joints. Additionally, there are subtle signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and potential subchondral sclerosis in the metacarpophalangeal joints.
