The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the distal humerus and proximal forearm, illustrating both the radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by an obvious discontinuity of the cortical bone with potential callus formation indicative of a healing process. There are also signs of adjacent soft tissue swelling, which may suggest associated soft tissue injury or edema around the fracture site.
