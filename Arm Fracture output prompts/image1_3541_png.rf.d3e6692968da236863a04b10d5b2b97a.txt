The image presents an X-ray of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is notable cortical irregularity and a potential fracture line observed in the distal humerus, which may indicate a recent traumatic injury. Additionally, periosteal reaction or soft tissue swelling may be inferred, suggesting inflammatory changes related to the underlying pathology.
