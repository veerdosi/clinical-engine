The X-ray image displays antero-posterior views of the proximal humerus and the surrounding soft tissue structures. There is a noticeable increase in the radiolucent area around the humeral head, suggestive of potential avascular necrosis or a pathological process. Additionally, signs of osteopenia are observed in the cortical bone, indicating possible underlying metabolic bone disease.
