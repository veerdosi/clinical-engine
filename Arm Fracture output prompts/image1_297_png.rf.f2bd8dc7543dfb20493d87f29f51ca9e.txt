The X-ray image presents the distal forearm and wrist region, demonstrating the radiographic outline of the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture through the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and associated soft tissue swelling indicative of potential hematoma formation. The carpal bones appear intact, with no visible dislocation, but the alignment and bony integrity suggest a significant injury that warrants further clinical assessment and management.
