The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left forearm, indicating a post-reduction status of a forearm fracture. Notably, there is significant cortical disruption observed in the radial and ulnar shafts, with signs of callus formation suggesting an ongoing healing process. The alignment of the bone appears restored, with no evident displacement visible at the fracture site.
