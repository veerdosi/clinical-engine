The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left hand, showing the anatomy of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable is a significant deformity in the second digit, where there appears to be an angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicative of a possible malalignment. There may also be signs of arthritis characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, particularly around the affected joints.
