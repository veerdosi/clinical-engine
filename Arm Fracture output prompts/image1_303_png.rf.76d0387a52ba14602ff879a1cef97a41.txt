The X-ray image displays a series of phalangeal bones of the hand, illustrating both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Notably, there is evidence of potential phalanx deformity in the second digit, characterized by an abnormal alignment or angulation of the bone. Additionally, joint space narrowing may be observed, indicative of possible osteoarthritic changes or other degenerative conditions affecting the digital joints.
