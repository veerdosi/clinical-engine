The X-ray image presented displays anteroposterior views of both hands, revealing the metaphyseal regions of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable radiographic findings indicate a symmetric soft tissue swelling and altered bone density that may suggest inflammatory arthropathy. Additionally, some of the distal interphalangeal joints demonstrate periarticular osteopenia, which can be associated with degenerative joint disease or inflammatory conditions.
