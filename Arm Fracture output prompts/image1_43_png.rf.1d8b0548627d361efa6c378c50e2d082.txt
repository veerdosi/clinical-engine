The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint, with clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of joint space narrowing, which may indicate early osteoarthritis or cartilage degeneration. Additionally, any significant bone deformities or alignment issues are not apparent in this view, suggesting a relatively intact skeletal structure surrounding the knee region.
