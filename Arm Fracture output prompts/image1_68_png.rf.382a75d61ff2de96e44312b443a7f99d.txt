The X-ray image demonstrates a right humerus and forearm with notable cortical disruption indicative of a possible fracture. There is evidence of periosteal reaction along the diaphysis, suggesting a healing response to an acute injury. Additionally, alignment of the elbow joint appears compromised, which may indicate potential complications such as malunion or instability post-injury.
