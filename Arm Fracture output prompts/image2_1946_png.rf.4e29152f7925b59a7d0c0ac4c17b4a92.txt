The X-ray image displays an adult shoulder with visible internal fixation hardware along the proximal humerus. There is an evident osteosynthesis plate with multiple screws, indicating prior surgical intervention likely related to a humeral fracture. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no acute findings of edema or effusion evident in the joint space.
