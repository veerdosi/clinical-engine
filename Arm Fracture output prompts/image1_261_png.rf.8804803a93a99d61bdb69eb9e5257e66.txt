The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the distal radius with significant angulation and displacement. There are notable soft tissue swelling and possible hematoma formation observed in the periarticular region, indicating an acute traumatic event. Additionally, the visualized alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears compromised, suggesting instability within the forearm structure.
