The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, specifically showing the radius and ulna bones. There is notable cortical bone thickening, which could suggest the presence of an underlying pathology such as osteosclerosis or a chronic inflammatory process. Additionally, there is an irregularity observed at the distal aspect of the radius, indicating the possibility of a fracture or malalignment that warrants further evaluation.
