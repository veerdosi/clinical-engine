The X-ray image displays the right wrist from a posterior-anterior view, presenting the carpal bones, distal radius, and distal ulna. Notable findings include potential sclerosis and irregularity in the joint space, which may indicate inflammatory changes or a degenerative joint condition. There is also evidence of joint effusion, which suggests synovitis or possible trauma in the surrounding structures.
