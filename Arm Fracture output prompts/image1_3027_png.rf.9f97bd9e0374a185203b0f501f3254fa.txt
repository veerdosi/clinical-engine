The X-ray image depicts the left wrist, revealing the carpal bones and their articulations with the radius and ulna. Notable in this image is the presence of an abnormal alignment of the carpals, which may suggest a possible malunion or instability at the scaphoid or lunate level. Additionally, signs of joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint could indicate degenerative changes or early osteoarthritis, although further clinical correlation is necessary for definitive diagnosis.
