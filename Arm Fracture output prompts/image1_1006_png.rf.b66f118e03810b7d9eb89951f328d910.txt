The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left forearm, specifically illustrating the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible alteration in bone alignment, with a distinct angulation at the wrist joint that may suggest the presence of a fracture or deformity. Additionally, there are signs of increased radiolucency around the joint space, indicative of potential soft tissue edema or joint effusion.
