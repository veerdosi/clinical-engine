The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the shoulder joint, revealing a probable humeral head deformity characterized by altered contours. The surrounding soft tissue demonstrates signs of swelling, which may suggest associated inflammatory processes such as bursitis or tendinopathy. Additionally, the relationship between the acromion and the humeral head could indicate potential impingement or rotator cuff involvement, warranting further evaluation.
