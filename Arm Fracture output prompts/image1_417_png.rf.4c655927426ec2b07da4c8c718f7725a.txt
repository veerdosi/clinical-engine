The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the left hand, where signs of potential joint osteoarthritis can be observed, characterized by marginal osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing. Additionally, there is evidence of subchondral sclerosis and possible cystic changes near the affected joints, indicative of chronic degenerative changes. No acute fractures or dislocations are apparent in the visualized skeletal structures, although soft tissue swelling may be suggested around the metacarpophalangeal joints.
