The X-ray image presents the skeletal structure of the right hand, showing the carpal bones and the phalanges in the wrist and fingers. Notable in the image is a potential alignment deviation in the fifth metacarpal, which may suggest a fracture or subluxation. Additionally, slight cortical irregularities are observed, indicating possible underlying osteochondral changes in the proximal phalanx of the second digit.
