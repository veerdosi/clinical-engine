The X-ray image displays a left forearm in an anteroposterior view, highlighting the radius and ulna along with the carpal and metacarpal bones of the wrist and hand. There is a notable angular deformity observed in the distal radius, suggesting the presence of a fracture, potentially a distal radius fracture commonly associated with falls. Additionally, alignment of the carpals and metacarpals should be evaluated for any signs of dislocation or malalignment, which could indicate associated soft tissue injuries.
