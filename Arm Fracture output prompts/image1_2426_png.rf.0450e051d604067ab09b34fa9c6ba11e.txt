The X-ray of the left knee demonstrates the presence of an intramedullary screw aligned within the femoral shaft, indicative of previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Radiographic findings reveal joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation, suggesting the presence of osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee. Additionally, there are signs of subchondral sclerosis, which may indicate chronic degenerative changes in the articular cartilage.
