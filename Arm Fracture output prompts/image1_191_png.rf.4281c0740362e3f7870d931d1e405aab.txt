The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the wrist joint, prominently displaying the distal radius and the proximal carpal bones. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by an indentation at the radial edge and surrounding edema, indicating possible recent trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears altered, raising suspicion for potential disruption or dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate bones.
