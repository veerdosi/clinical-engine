The X-ray image displays an adult human knee joint post-operative indication of an internal fixation device, specifically a metal plate and screws positioned laterally along the femur. There is evidence of altered bone architecture, suggesting a history of osteotomy or fracture, evidenced by the metallic hardware used for stabilization. Additionally, there is a potential presence of post-surgical changes around the implant, which may denote healing or reactive changes in the surrounding soft tissues.
