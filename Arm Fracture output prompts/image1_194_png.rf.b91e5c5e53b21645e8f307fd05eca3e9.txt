The X-ray image reveals a deformity in the distal phalanx of the finger, characterized by an abnormal angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint. There is evidence of subluxation, indicating a misalignment of the joint, which may suggest the presence of an underlying injury or pathology. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the joint, which may implicate inflammatory changes associated with trauma or other pathological conditions.
