The x-ray depicts a lateral view of the forearm, highlighting a metallic intramedullary nail positioned within the diaphysis of the radius and ulna. There is evident cortical disruption consistent with a prior fracture, and the alignment of the osseous structures appears compromised due to the history of trauma. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema, indicative of potential inflammation or healing post-surgery.
