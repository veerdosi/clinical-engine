The image displays a lateral radiograph of the right elbow joint, revealing a notable displacement at the humeroulnar articulation. There are signs of joint effusion, indicated by the presence of a radiolucent crescent at the olecranon fossa, which may suggest underlying inflammation. Additionally, the alignment of the humerus and ulna appears compromised, potentially indicating a fracture or dislocation within the joint.
