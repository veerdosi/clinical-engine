The image depicts an anteroposterior X-ray view of the forearm, primarily showing the radius and ulna. Both bones appear to be properly aligned; however, there is notable evidence of a fracture in the distal radius with displacement. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be observed, suggesting an acute injury requiring further evaluation and management.
