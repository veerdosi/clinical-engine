The X-ray image displays an oblique fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a notable disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicative of associated hematoma formation. Additionally, the angular deformity observed suggests a potential malalignment of the bone fragments, which may require further evaluation for proper management.
