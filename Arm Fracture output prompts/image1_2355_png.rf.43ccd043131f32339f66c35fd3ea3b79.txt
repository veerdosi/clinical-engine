The X-ray image of the left wrist and hand reveals the presence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by discontinuity in the cortical bone. There is also an indication of possible soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, suggestive of accompanying inflammation. Furthermore, alignment of the carpal bones appears disturbed, which may point toward a possible misalignment or subluxation involving the wrist joint.
