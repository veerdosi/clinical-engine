The X-ray demonstrates an anterior view of the left humerus, revealing the presence of an intramedullary nail used for internal fixation. Notable signs of osteosynthesis are evident, with clear visualization of the fixation device and surrounding bone integrity. There is an absence of acute fractures or significant bone pathology, suggesting successful stabilization of a prior injury.
