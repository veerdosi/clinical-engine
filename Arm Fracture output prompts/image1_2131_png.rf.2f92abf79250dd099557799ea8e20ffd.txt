The x-ray depicts a left wrist with internal fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, positioned along the distal radius. There is evidence of a comminuted fracture in the distal radius, indicated by the irregular fracture lines and the presence of the surgical implant. Surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, and there is a potential radiolucent line suggestive of early osseous healing response.
