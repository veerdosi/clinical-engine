The X-ray image illustrates a left shoulder with prominent metallic hardware, indicative of recent surgical intervention. There is a visible fracture of the proximal humerus, characterized by displacement suggestive of a significant bone injury. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no evidence of acute hematoma or surrounding osseous changes.
