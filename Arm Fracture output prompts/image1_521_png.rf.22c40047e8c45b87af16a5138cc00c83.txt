The image shows an X-ray of the left forearm displaying an intramedullary nail fixation along the diaphysis of the ulna. There is evidence of a prior fracture as indicated by the surgical hardware used for stabilization, including multiple screws fixing the nail to the bone. The surrounding soft tissues appear normal, with no signs of acute complications such as infection or additional fractures noted in this view.
