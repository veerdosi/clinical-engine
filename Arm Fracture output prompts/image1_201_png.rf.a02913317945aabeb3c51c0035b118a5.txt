The X-ray image depicts the knee joint in a flexed position, clearly showing the femur, tibia, and fibula. There appears to be a presence of an osteophyte at the joint margins, indicative of osteoarthritis, which may suggest degenerative changes. Additionally, joint space narrowing is noted, suggesting potential loss of cartilage and further supporting the diagnosis of osteoarthritis.
