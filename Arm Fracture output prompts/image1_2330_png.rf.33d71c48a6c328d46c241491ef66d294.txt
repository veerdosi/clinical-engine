The x-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left elbow, showing the distal humerus and proximal ulna. There is the presence of an intramedullary nail stabilizing a fracture in the ulna, indicating a surgical fixation of a complex fracture pattern. Additionally, the joint space appears intact, with no visible signs of degenerative changes or associated soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area.
