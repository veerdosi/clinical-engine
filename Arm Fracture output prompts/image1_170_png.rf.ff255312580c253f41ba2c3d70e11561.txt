The X-ray image displays an oblique view of the left humerus, specifically highlighting the proximal humeral region. There appears to be a clear sign of an avulsion fracture at the greater tuberosity, with possible displacement noted. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be suggested, indicative of an associated soft tissue injury or hematoma in the surrounding area.
