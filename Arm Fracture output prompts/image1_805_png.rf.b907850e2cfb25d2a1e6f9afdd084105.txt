The x-ray image displays the right knee joint, illustrating the femur, tibia, and fibula. There are notable signs of joint effusion and possible osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint space, suggestive of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis). Additionally, the alignment of the knee joint appears compromised, indicating potential varus or valgus deformity.
