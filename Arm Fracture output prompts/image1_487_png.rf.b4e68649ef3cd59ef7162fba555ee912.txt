The image presents a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable findings include joint space narrowing and potential irregularities at the olecranon, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis or another degenerative joint condition. Additionally, the proximal radius and associated soft tissue structures appear unremarkable, without evident signs of fracture or acute injury.
