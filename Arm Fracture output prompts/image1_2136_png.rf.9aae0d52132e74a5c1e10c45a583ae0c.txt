The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the wrist and hand, with particular attention to the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, as well as signs of possible degenerative changes, characterized by subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are irregularities in the contour of the scaphoid bone, suggesting a potential fracture or non-union that requires further evaluation.
