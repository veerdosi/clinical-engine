The X-ray image reveals a right wrist with an apparent fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a displacement at the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, which may indicate underlying trauma or injury. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, suggesting that there are no concurrent fractures in the proximal carpal region.
