The X-ray demonstrates a right wrist in an anteroposterior view, illustrating the alignment and integrity of the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notably, there is evidence of misalignment in the distal radius, which may suggest the presence of a fracture or a malunion affecting the wrist joint function. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the joint appears to have edema, which is indicative of potential underlying trauma or inflammation.
