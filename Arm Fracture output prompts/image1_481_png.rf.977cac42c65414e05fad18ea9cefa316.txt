The X-ray presented shows an anteroposterior view of the right wrist joint, including the distal radius and ulna. The image reveals a possible fracture line at the distal radius, indicated by cortical disruption and surrounding soft tissue edema, suggestive of acute trauma. Additionally, there is joint effusion evident at the radiocarpal joint space, which may indicate associated ligamentous injury or intra-articular pathology.
