The X-ray image displays the right humerus and elbow region, with a notable abnormality observed at the distal end of the humerus. There is evidence of an osseous lesion characterized by an expansile radiolucent area, suggestive of possible neoplastic changes. Additionally, there appears to be cortical thinning and potential involvement of the adjacent soft tissues, which may indicate an aggressive process requiring further evaluation.
