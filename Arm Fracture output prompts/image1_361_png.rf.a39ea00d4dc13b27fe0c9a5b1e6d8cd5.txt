The X-ray image demonstrates the left shoulder joint, showing the humerus and glenoid cavity of the scapula. There appears to be a significant irregularity along the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may indicate the presence of a humeral head avulsion or degenerative changes. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion, suggesting possible underlying inflammatory or degenerative joint disease, such as rotator cuff pathology or osteoarthritis.
