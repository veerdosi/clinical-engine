The X-ray image depicts the left hand, showcasing the phalanges of the fingers and the metacarpals, with clear visualization of the carpometacarpal joints. Notably, there is evidence of a possible fracture or malalignment in one of the distal phalanges, which may suggest an acute traumatic injury. The surrounding soft tissues appear intact, without significant swelling or periosteal reaction evident in the image.
