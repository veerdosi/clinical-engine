The image presents an X-ray of the left hand, specifically focusing on the bones of the index finger. Notable findings include a pronounced longitudinal fracture of the distal phalanx, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there appears to be some degree of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury.
