The X-ray image shows the left forearm, including the ulna and radius, in an extended position. Notably, there is evidence of an angular deformity at the distal radius, which may suggest the presence of a fracture. Additionally, joint spaces appear to be narrowed, which could indicate degenerative changes or osteoarthritis within the wrist.
