The x-ray image depicts the forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is an angulated fracture observed in the distal radius, which appears to be displaced. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones in the wrist joint demonstrates potential involvement in the fracture pattern, warranting further evaluation for associated injuries.
