The image depicts an anteroposterior view of the elbow joint, showcasing the distal humerus and proximal ulna, along with the adjacent soft tissue structures. There is evidence of possible joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the olecranon fossa, which may suggest an inflammatory response. Mild cortical irregularity observed at the medial epicondyle of the humerus may indicate an acute or chronic injury, such as a stress fracture or avulsion injury.
