The image exhibits an X-ray of the left knee joint, demonstrating the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau. There is noticeable evidence of joint space narrowing, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the distal femur shows subchondral sclerosis, suggesting underlying bone remodeling associated with chronic stress or osteoarthritic changes.
