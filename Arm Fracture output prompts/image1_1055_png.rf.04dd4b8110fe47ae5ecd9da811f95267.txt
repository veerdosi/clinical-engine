The X-ray image demonstrates a clear visualization of the left shoulder joint, with noticeable alteration in the normal anatomical alignment. There is evidence of a humeral head displacement, suggesting a possible anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the joint, indicating potential associated soft tissue injury that is often seen with such dislocations.
