The X-ray image shows an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by irregularities in the cortical margins and displacement at the fracture site. There is notable soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture, and the alignment of the distal radius and ulna appears compromised. Internal fixation devices, likely metal plates or screws, are evident, indicating prior surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture and promote healing.
