The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the forearm, revealing abnormal radiological findings in the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture involving the distal end of the radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity and displacement. Additionally, signs of periosteal reaction are observed, suggesting a potential underlying pathology that may contribute to compromised bone integrity.
