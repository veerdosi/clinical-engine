The X-ray image depicts a right forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of an angulated fracture of the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by displacement and cortical disruption. Additionally, the alignment of the distal radioulnar joint appears compromised, which may indicate associated soft tissue or ligamentous injury.
