The X-ray image displays a right forearm with visible anatomical structures including the radius and ulna. Notable is a significant radiolucent area in the distal radius, suggesting potential pathological changes such as a fracture or possibly an osteolytic lesion. The alignment of the bones appears intact, but there may be abnormalities in cortical thickness or periosteal reaction that warrant further evaluation.
