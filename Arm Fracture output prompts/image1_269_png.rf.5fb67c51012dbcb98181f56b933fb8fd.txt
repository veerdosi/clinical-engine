The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the elbow joint and the proximal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a radial head fracture characterized by a displaced fragment, appearing radiolucent against the surrounding osseous structures. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion, indicated by the presence of increased soft tissue density surrounding the elbow, suggesting possible associated trauma or inflammation.
