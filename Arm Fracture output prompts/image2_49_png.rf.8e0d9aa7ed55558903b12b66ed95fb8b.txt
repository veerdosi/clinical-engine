The image portrays an X-ray of the left forearm, specifically revealing the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity, with some degree of angulation observed. Surrounding soft tissue appears to be unharmed, but there may be signs of periosteal reaction consistent with a recent fracture.
