The X-ray image illustrates an ellipsoid-shaped radiolucency adjacent to the distal humerus, suggesting the presence of an effusion or possible intra-articular pathology within the elbow joint. There is noticeable bone spurring at the margins of the ulna, which may indicate underlying osteophyte formation consistent with degenerative joint disease. Additionally, the alignment of the bony structures appears disrupted, raising suspicion for an associated ligamentous injury or a potential fracture in the surrounding osseous anatomy.
