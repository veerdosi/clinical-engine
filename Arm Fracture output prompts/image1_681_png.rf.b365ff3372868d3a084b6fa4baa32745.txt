The X-ray image of the left knee joint reveals significant osteophyte formation indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. There is also evidence of effusion within the joint cavity, as observed by the increased radiolucency adjacent to the femoral and tibial condyles. Furthermore, the presence of marginal bone spurs suggests chronic degenerative changes consistent with a long-standing degenerative joint disease.
