The X-ray image demonstrates a left forearm with evident diaphyseal fractures of both the radius and ulna, characterized by displacement and angulation. There is a notable fracture at the mid-shaft of both bones, which suggests a significant traumatic event. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be present, indicating an acute response to the underlying fracture pathology.
