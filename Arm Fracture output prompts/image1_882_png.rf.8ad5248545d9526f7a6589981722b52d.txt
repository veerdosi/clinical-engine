The provided X-ray image reveals the left knee joint and adjacent structures, including the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable is the presence of a potential osteophyte formation at the patellar joint space, which may indicate degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the alignment of the articulating surfaces appears altered, suggesting possible joint malalignment or instability, warranting further evaluation for underlying pathology.
