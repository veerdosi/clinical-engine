The X-ray image displays the right hand with a prominent focus on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a noted angulation or deviation in one or more of the distal phalanges, which may suggest an underlying deformity such as a malalignment. Additionally, the presence of any abnormal joint spacing or bony changes could indicate conditions such as arthritis or a previous fracture healing inadequately, necessitating further evaluation.
