The X-ray reveals a significant tendon-related pathology in the region of the shoulder, with a potential indication of a rotator cuff tear. Notable is the retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, which may suggest a traumatic injury or degenerative changes leading to impaired shoulder function. Additionally, there is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, raising suspicion for subacromial bursitis or impingement syndrome.
