The X-ray demonstrates a right hand in a posteroanterior view, revealing the alignment and condition of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable are the signs of possible osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there may be evidence of a malunion or nonunion in one of the metacarpals, indicated by irregular bone contours and potential displacement.
