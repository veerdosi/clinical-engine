The X-ray image displays the articulations of the carpals and metacarpals in the wrist and hand region. There is evidence of deformity characterized by the presence of osteophytes, indicative of degenerative joint disease, possibly osteoarthritis. Additionally, joint spacing appears narrowed, suggesting potential chondral damage or cartilage degeneration, which is consistent with chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the wrist.
