The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left shoulder joint, illustrating the humeral head and glenoid cavity. Notably, there appears to be a significant disruption in the normal contours of the proximal humerus, which may indicate a humeral head fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there are signs of possible associated soft tissue swelling, suggesting underlying trauma or acute inflammatory processes in the shoulder region.
