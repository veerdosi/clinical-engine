The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit (little finger). Notable radiographic findings include an intra-articular fracture at the base of the phalanx, characterized by the displacement and angulation of the bone fragments. Additionally, the image shows surgical fixation with Kirschner wires (K-wires), indicating prior intervention for fracture stabilization.
