The X-ray image demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the forearm, highlighting the ulna and radius. There is evidence of a transverse fracture characterized by irregular alignment at the midshaft of the radius, with a notable disruption of the cortical bone integrity. Additionally, there appears to be accompanying soft tissue edema around the fracture site, indicative of post-traumatic changes.
