The X-ray image depicts the left knee joint in a lateral view, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable observations include possible signs of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling in the suprapatellar space, along with some irregularities in the contour of the femoral condyle. There is a noticeable presence of osteophyte formation at the inferior aspect of the patella, suggesting potential degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
