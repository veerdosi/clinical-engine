The X-ray image displays a right wrist, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notable is the presence of a fracture in the distal radius, which exhibits signs of displacement and potential angulation at the fracture site. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the wrist joint, suggesting an accompanying contusion or hematoma.
