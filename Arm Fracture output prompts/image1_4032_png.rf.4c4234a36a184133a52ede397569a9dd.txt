The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the hand, showcasing the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex along with possible soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area. Additionally, joint spaces appear preserved, indicating a lack of arthritic changes, while the alignment of the distal joints remains anatomically correct despite the noted fracture.
