The X-ray image depicts the left lower leg, including the tibia and fibula, with clear visualization of the bone structures and joint alignment. Notably, there is a marked cortical disruption, suggesting the presence of a fracture possibly affecting the integrity of the tibia. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears adjacent to the bone, with no evident joint effusion or acute abnormality in the knee region.
