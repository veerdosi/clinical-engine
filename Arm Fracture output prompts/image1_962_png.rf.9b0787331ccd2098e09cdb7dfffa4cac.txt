The X-ray image displayed shows the bones of a human hand, specifically the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of what appears to be a malalignment of the distal phalanges, indicating a potential deformity in the finger structure. Additionally, some of the joint spaces seem narrowed, which may suggest osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease affecting the interphalangeal joints.
