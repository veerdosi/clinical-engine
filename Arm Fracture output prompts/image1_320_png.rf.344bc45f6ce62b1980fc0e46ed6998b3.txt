The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the right knee joint, revealing the alignment and structural integrity of the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is increased radiolucency along the metaphysis of the femur, which may suggest the presence of osteopenia or a bone lesion. Additionally, the joint space appears preserved, but further evaluation is necessary to rule out any degenerative changes or intra-articular pathology.
