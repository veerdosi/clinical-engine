The X-ray image depicts the left humerus and surrounding structures, showing significant soft tissue density obscuring the visualization of bony anatomy. There is evidence of possible fracture lines within the proximal humerus region, accompanied by periosteal reaction indicative of potential trauma or underlying pathologic process. Additionally, the glenohumeral joint appears obscured, which may correlate with effusion or other joint abnormalities relevant to inflammatory conditions.
