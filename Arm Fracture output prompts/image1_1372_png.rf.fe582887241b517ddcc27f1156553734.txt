The X-ray image depicts an oblique view of the left shoulder, highlighting both the glenohumeral joint and the proximal humerus. There appears to be a notable osseous deformity or irregularity at the humeral head, which may suggest a possible fracture or degenerative change. Surrounding soft tissues may exhibit signs of edema or associated pathologies, indicating potential inflammation or injury in the region.
