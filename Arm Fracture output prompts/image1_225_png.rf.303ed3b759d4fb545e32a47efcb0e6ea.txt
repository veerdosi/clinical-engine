The X-ray image depicts the right hand, with particular emphasis on the metacarpal and phalangeal bones. There is notable evidence of a possible fracture in the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the overall alignment of the joint spaces appears intact, with no signs of significant degenerative changes or systemic bone diseases present.
