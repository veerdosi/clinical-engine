The X-ray image demonstrates a left shoulder with internal fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, suggesting a history of surgical intervention for a fracture. There is visible cortical disruption in the proximal humerus consistent with a fracture pattern that may have necessitated this operative approach. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema or reactive changes related to the surgical intervention, but further imaging would be required to assess these details.
