The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, including the proximal humerus, scapula, and the glenohumeral joint space. There is evidence of a potential acromioclavicular joint separation, indicated by an irregularity in the articulation between the acromion and the clavicle. Additionally, there is a noticeable reduction in joint space, suggesting the presence of subacromial impingement or potential rotator cuff pathology.
