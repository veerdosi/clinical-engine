The X-ray image displays the forearm, specifically the radius and ulna, with notable abnormalities. There is evidence of a fracture at the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the bone cortex, as well as some possible angulation observed in the ulna. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no evident dislocation or subluxation in the wrist joint.
