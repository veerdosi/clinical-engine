The X-ray reveals a lateral view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the ulna and radius in relation to the humerus. There is evidence of cortical disruption along the radial aspect, suggestive of a possible fracture or traumatic osteopathy. Additionally, joint effusion may be present, indicated by the increased lucency around the articulation, which could be associated with inflammatory processes or trauma.
