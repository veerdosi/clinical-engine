The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the wrist and forearm region, revealing the distal radius and ulna. There appears to be a notable fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement and angulation, consistent with a typical Colles' fracture. Additionally, signs of bony edema may be present around the fracture site, suggesting possible associated soft tissue injury and trauma.
