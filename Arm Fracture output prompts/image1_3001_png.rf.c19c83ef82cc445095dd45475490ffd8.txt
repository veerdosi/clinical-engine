The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the wrist, showing the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the integrity of the bone cortex and potential angulation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears altered, suggestive of possible displacement related to the fracture of the distal radius.
