The radiograph exhibits a right forearm, demonstrating signs of a diaphyseal fracture in the distal radius and ulna, characterized by disrupted cortical continuity. There is notable periosteal reaction evident along the fracture margins, suggesting an acute nature of the injury. Additionally, alignment of the radius and ulna appears compromised, indicative of potential malalignment or instability in the forearm structure.
