The X-ray image shows a lateral view of a finger, with clear visualization of the phalanges and their alignment. There is evidence of a possible fracture within the distal phalanx, where cortical disruption and soft tissue swelling may be observed surrounding the area. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the distal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate underlying trauma or inflammatory processes.
