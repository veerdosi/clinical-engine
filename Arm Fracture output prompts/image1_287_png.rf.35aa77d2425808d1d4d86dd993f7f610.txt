The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the femur and patella, indicating a possible fracture in the distal femur region. There is an indication of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process is underway. Additionally, the alignment of the long bone appears to be compromised, which may indicate a malunion or possible angulation deformity following trauma.
