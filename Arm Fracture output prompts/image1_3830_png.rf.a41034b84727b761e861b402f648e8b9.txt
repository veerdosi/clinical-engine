The x-ray displays the skeletal structures of the hand, with particular focus on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is an observable deviation of one or more phalanges, which may indicate the presence of a deformity or malalignment such as lateral deviation consistent with conditions like ulnar drift. Additionally, any signs of joint space narrowing or subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal joints could suggest a possible underlying inflammatory arthropathy, though specific pathology is not discernible from the image alone.
