The X-ray image shows a right forearm with clear visualization of the distal radius and ulna. Notable findings include a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by abnormal angulation or displacement, which may indicate an acute injury. Additionally, there is a lack of normal periosteal reaction, suggesting that chronic pathologies are less likely in this instance.
