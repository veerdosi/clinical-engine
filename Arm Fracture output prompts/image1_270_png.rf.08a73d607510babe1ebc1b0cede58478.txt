The X-ray image demonstrates an anterior view of the shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, there is evidence of glenohumeral joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the humeral head, which may suggest underlying pathology such as rotator cuff tear or bursitis. Additionally, there are signs of possible degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and subcutaneous sclerosis.
