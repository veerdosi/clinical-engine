The X-ray image displays the right arm with a defined view of both the humerus and forearm bones, prominently showing the ulna and radius in an extended position. There is a notable cortical disruption at the mid-shaft of the ulna, indicating a possible fracture that requires further evaluation for displacement or alignment issues. Surrounding soft tissues appear to be intact, with no significant signs of periosteal reaction or hematoma observed in this projection.
