The image presents an X-ray of the right forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna. There is a clear indication of potential cortical disruption in one or both of the distal bone structures, suggesting a possible fracture. Additionally, there is a noticeable displacement or angulation of the bone fragments, which may indicate the presence of a fracture-dislocation pattern.
