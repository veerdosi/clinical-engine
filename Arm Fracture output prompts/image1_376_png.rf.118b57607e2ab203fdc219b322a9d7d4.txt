The X-ray image depicts the left humerus, radius, and ulna of an individual with the elbow in a flexed position. There is evidence of a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may suggest acute trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears normal with no signs of angulation or displacement, indicating that it remains intact despite the potential injury to the radius.
