The X-ray shows the distal radius and ulnar bones of the left wrist, with notable alignment of the carpal bones. There is evidence of a potential fracture or avulsions at the distal end of the radius, appearing as a radiolucent line that suggests disruption of the cortical margin. Additionally, mild soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint may be observed, indicative of a possible inflammatory process or hematoma formation.
