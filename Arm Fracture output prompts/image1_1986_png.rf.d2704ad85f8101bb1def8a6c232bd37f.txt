The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left wrist, demonstrating an osteosynthesis procedure with metallic fixation devices in place. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, indicated by a pronounced disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue swelling may suggest an inflammatory response associated with the fracture site or postoperative changes.
