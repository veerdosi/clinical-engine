The X-ray image presents the forearm, displaying the ulna and radius in profile view. A prominent feature noted is a localized radiolucent area suggesting a possible fracture line or a non-union at the midshaft region of the radius. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating potential inflammatory or pathological processes in the affected area.
