The X-ray image displays the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures in an externally rotated view. Notable is a presence of a potentially large impingement, indicated by proximal humeral erosion, suggesting rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, there may be signs of acromioclavicular joint arthrosis, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible osteophyte formation adjacent to the acromion.
