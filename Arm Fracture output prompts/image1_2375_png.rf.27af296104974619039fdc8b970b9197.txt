The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right hand, prominently highlighting the phalangeal bones. Notable is the presence of a Bennett fracture, characterized by an intra-articular fracture at the base of the first metacarpal, leading to potential joint instability. Additionally, there is visible joint effusion around the metacarpophalangeal joint, which may suggest associated soft tissue or cartilage injury.
