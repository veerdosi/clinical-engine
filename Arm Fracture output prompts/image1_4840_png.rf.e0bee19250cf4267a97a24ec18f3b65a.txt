The X-ray image displays the left hand, with particular emphasis on the phalangeal structures. There is a visible malalignment of the second proximal phalanx, suggestive of a possible fracture or dislocation, as indicated by the abnormal angulation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be noted around the affected area, which could imply an underlying injury or inflammation in the surrounding structures.
