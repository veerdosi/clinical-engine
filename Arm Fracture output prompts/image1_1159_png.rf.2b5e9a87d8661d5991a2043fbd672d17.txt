The X-ray image displays a left wrist with visible osseous deformities, indicating a distal radius fracture. In addition, there are metallic fixation devices present, suggesting surgical intervention for fracture stabilization, likely involving internal fixation techniques. The surrounding soft tissue structures may exhibit signs of edema; however, these are not explicitly visible in the radiographic image.
