The X-ray image displays the right hand, specifically focusing on the metacarpal bones and phalanges. There is a notable indication of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the distal phalanx of the third digit, suggesting a possible trauma-related injury. Additionally, there is a prominent bony protrusion at the base of the proximal phalanx, which may indicate the presence of a bony deformity or a possible bone cyst.
