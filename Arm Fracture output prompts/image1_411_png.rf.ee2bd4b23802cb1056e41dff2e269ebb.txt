The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left wrist, showcasing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a potential scaphoid fracture indicated by a radiolucent line within the scaphoid bone, which may correlate with an acute injury or trauma. Additionally, slight misalignment of the distal radial fragment suggests possible wrist instability, warranting further clinical evaluation for associated ligamentous or tendinous damage.
