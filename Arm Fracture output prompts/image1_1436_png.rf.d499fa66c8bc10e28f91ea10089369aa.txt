The image depicts an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the right knee joint, with particular attention to the femur, tibia, and patella. Notable findings include a likely effusion of the knee joint, indicated by a crescent-shaped lucency surrounding the patella, suggesting possible intra-articular pathology. Additionally, there is a prominent subluxation of the patella, which may be associated with underlying conditions such as patellar instability or previous trauma.
