The X-ray demonstrates significant joint effusion within the knee joint, indicated by the presence of an increased radiolucency surrounding the femoral and tibial condyles. There is a notable irregularity at the articular surfaces, suggesting possible osteoarthritis or degenerative changes, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident, which may indicate an underlying inflammatory process or trauma.
