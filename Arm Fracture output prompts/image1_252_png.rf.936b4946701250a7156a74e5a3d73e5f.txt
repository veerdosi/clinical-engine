The X-ray image displays the right hand, focusing on the phalangeal bones of the fingers. There is evidence of a possible fracture in one of the distal phalanges, characterized by an irregularity in the cortical outline and disruption of the trabecular pattern. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling around the affected digit, suggesting a potential inflammatory response.
