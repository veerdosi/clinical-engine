The X-ray image presents a right hand in an oblique position, clearly showing the metacarpals and phalanges. There is notable angulation and possible malalignment of the digits, which may suggest a deformity such as a boutonni√®re or swan-neck deformity. Additionally, the overall bone density appears normal, with no signs of acute fractures or dislocations evident in the skeletal structure depicted.
