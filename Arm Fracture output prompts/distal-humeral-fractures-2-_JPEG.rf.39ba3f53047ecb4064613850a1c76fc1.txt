The X-ray image displays the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula. There appears to be a notable joint effusion, indicating the presence of excess synovial fluid, which may suggest an inflammatory or traumatic process. In addition to joint effusion, there are irregularities in bone morphology around the joint, potentially indicative of degenerative changes or osteochondral lesions.
