The X-ray image displays a right forearm, focusing on the radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of a diaphyseal fracture of the radius with a slight bowing deformity, indicating possible previous trauma or stress. Additionally, there is an assessment of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest an inflammatory process or hematoma.
