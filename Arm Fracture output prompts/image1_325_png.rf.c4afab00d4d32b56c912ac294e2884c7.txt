The X-ray image shows the radiographic view of the left forearm, encompassing both the radius and ulna. There is a noteworthy radiolucent line observed through the middle third of the radius, suggestive of a possible transverse fracture. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable with no evidence of edema or hematoma visible in this view.
