The X-ray image displays the right hand in a position indicative of a raised index finger, with the thumb and other fingers forming a 'thumbs up' gesture. Notably, there is evidence of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing between the proximal interphalangeal joints and the presence of subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there may be indications of a malalignment of the phalanges, which could suggest the presence of a deformity such as a boutonniere or swan-neck deformity.
