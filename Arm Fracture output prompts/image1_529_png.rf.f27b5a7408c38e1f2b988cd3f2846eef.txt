The image depicts an X-ray of the right lower leg, specifically showing the tibia and fibula bones in a lateral view. Notable in this X-ray are signs consistent with a transverse fracture of the distal fibula, characterized by a complete break across the bone. Additionally, there is an indication of mild angulation in the alignment of the tibia, which may suggest potential displacement related to the fracture.
