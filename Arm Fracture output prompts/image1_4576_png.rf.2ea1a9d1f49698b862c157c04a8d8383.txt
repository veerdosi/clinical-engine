The X-ray image displays multiple views of the left hand, highlighting the bones of the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable in the image is the presence of bony deformities in the second and third metacarpal bones, which may suggest the possibility of a form of arthritis or trauma-related changes. Additionally, there are signs of joint effusion in the proximal interphalangeal joints, indicating potential inflammatory changes or associated pathology.
