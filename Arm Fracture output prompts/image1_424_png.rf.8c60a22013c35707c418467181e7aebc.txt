The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the right forearm, demonstrating the alignment of the radius and ulna. Notable findings include the presence of a periosteal reaction along the shafts of both bones, which may indicate recent trauma or an active process. There are no apparent signs of acute fractures; however, the surrounding soft tissue shadows suggest a potential effusion or hematoma in the elbow joint region.
