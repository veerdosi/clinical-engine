The X-ray image displays the left forearm, specifically visualizing the radius and ulna in a lateral projection. There is a notable deformity characterized by angulation of the bone structure, which may indicate a radial or ulnar fracture. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the area suggest a potential inflammatory response or hematoma formation related to the underlying bone pathology.
