The X-ray shows an apparent diaphyseal fracture in the radius and ulna, characterized by a disruption of cortical continuity. There is notable displacement of the fracture fragments, indicating potential angulation and shortening of the forearm bones. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be suggested by the periosteal reaction observed, which is often associated with acute fractures.
