The radiograph presented is of the left forearm in a lateral view, demonstrating alignment and osseous anatomy. Notable is the presence of a fracture through the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by disruption in cortical continuity with surrounding periosteal reaction. Additionally, the ulna appears intact with no signs of osseous lesions or deformities evident in the imaging analysis.
