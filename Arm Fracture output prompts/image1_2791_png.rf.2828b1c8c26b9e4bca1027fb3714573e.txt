The X-ray image displays multiple views of the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal bones of the thumb and the first metacarpal. The presence of foreign bodies, consistent with metallic pins, is observed in the phalanx, indicating potential previous surgical intervention or fixation due to an underlying injury. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, suggesting possible deformity or malunion, which may require further evaluation or intervention.
