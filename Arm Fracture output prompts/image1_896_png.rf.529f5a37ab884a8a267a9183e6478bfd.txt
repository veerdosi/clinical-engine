The X-ray image displays an orthopedic fixation device, indicating surgical intervention on the left elbow. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal humerus, evidenced by disrupted bone continuity and alignment, combined with the presence of metallic hardware suggesting internal fixation. The surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema or inflammation, which are commonly associated with post-operative healing processes.
