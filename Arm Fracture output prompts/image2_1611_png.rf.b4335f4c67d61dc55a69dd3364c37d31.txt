The radiographic image demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the lower leg, highlighting the tibia and fibula. Notably, there is evidence of a distal fibular fracture characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity, along with accompanying soft tissue edema. The alignment of the ankle joint appears compromised, raising the suspicion of a possible associated ligamentous injury or instability in the adjacent structures.
