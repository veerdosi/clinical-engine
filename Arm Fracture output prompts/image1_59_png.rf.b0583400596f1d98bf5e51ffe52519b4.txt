The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right forearm, prominently displaying the radius and ulna. Both bones appear to be intact without any visible fractures or significant deformities, indicating normal anatomical alignment. The radiographic density of the cortical and trabecular bone structures suggests adequate bone mineralization, with no signs of osteopenia or osteolytic lesions evident in the visualized area.
