The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing an internal fixation device, which indicates a prior surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. There is evidence of a previous humeral or ulnar fracture, characterized by altered bone density and cortical disruption in the area adjacent to the hardware. The surrounding soft tissues appear within normal limits, with no signs of acute swelling or abnormal fluid collection visible in the joint space.
