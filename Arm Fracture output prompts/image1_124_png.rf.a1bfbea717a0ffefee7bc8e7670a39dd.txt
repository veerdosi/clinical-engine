The X-ray image displays multiple views of the left hand, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there are signs of joint degeneration, possibly indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and potential subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there appears to be a possible fracture in one of the distal phalanxes, evidenced by the irregularity in the cortical bone in the affected area.
