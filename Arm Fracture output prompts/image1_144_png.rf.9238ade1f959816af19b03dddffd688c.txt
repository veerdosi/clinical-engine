The X-ray images reveal the right wrist and forearm, displaying the radiographic anatomy of the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, accompanied by soft tissue swelling indicative of an associated contusion or hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears compromised, suggesting a possible fracture-dislocation pattern, warranting further clinical correlation and evaluation.
