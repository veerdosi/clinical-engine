The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the knee joint, revealing significant joint effusion in the suprapatellar bursa, indicative of potential inflammatory processes. There is also evidence of subchondral sclerosis in the femoral condyles, which may suggest osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, minor osteophyte formation is observed at the edges of the patella, consistent with chronic joint degeneration.
