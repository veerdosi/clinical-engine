The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left forearm, including the radius and ulna. There is noted cortical irregularity along the mid-shaft of the ulna, suggestive of a possible pathological process or a prior fracture healing with malalignment. Additionally, the radiographic appearance presents a potential trabecular bone loss, which may indicate osteopenia or other underlying metabolic bone disorders.
