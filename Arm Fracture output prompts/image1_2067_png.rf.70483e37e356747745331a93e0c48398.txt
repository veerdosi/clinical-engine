The X-ray image depicts the right hand, revealing multiple bone structures in the phalanges. There is an observable deformity in the configuration of the fingers, which suggests possible conditions such as malformation or arthritic changes affecting the joint spaces. The soft tissue surrounding the bones appears unremarkable, with no signs of swelling or other acute inflammatory processes evident in the image.
