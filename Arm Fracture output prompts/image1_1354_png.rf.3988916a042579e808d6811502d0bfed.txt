The X-ray image depicts a left shoulder, showing the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding soft tissue structures. Notably, there is an apparent osseous deformity or joint space narrowing that suggests a potential degenerative condition, possibly indicating osteoarthritis or a rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, abnormal bony protrusions or calcifications may be observed, indicating possible enthesopathic changes or chronic inflammatory processes in the shoulder region.
