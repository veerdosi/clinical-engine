The X-ray image demonstrates a right femur with notable cortical irregularities, suggesting possible osteolytic lesions or areas of decreased bone density. Additionally, there is a distinct angulation in the distal femur, potentially indicative of a malalignment or underlying deformity such as varus or valgus deformity. Further evaluation may be warranted to assess the extent of any pathological changes and to rule out conditions such as fractures, tumors, or developmental anomalies in the bone structure.
