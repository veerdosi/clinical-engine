The radiographic image depicts the right hand in a lateromedial projection, highlighting the bony architecture of the phalanges. Notable is the presence of a deviation at the interphalangeal joints, suggestive of possible digital deformity such as a boutonni√®re or swan-neck deformity. Additionally, structural abnormalities may be evident in the proximal and distal phalanges, indicating potential degenerative changes or inflammatory arthropathy, which can be associated with conditions like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
