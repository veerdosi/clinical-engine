The radiographic image of the wrist demonstrates significant dorsal angulation of the distal radius, suggestive of a distal radius fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of intra-articular involvement, indicated by a fracture line extending into the wrist joint. The alignment of the carpals appears maintained, with no apparent dislocation noted in the visualized bone structure.
