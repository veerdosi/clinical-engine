The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the hand, highlighting a noticeable osseous injury to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a comminuted fracture. There is evidence of surrounding soft tissue edema, indicating a reactive process, which suggests recent trauma. Additionally, the presence of a metallic foreign body near the base of the proximal phalanx may indicate previous surgical intervention or external injury.
