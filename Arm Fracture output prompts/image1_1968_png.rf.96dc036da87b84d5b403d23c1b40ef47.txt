The X-ray image of the hand demonstrates an alignment of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones, with visibility of the joint spaces. Notably, there appears to be a malalignment of the proximal phalanx of the second digit, suggesting a potential fracture or dislocation. Furthermore, the soft tissue surrounding the phalanges shows no signs of significant edema or effusion, indicating a likely lack of acute inflammatory processes.
