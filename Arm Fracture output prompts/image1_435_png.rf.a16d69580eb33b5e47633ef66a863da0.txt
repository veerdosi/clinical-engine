The X-ray image demonstrates the left knee joint, revealing a potential presence of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling surrounding the area. There is notable proximity of the femoral condyles to the tibial plateau, and the alignment of the joint surfaces appears compromised, indicating possible meniscal injury or ligamentous involvement. Additionally, any signs of osteophyte formation or bone spurs are not distinctly visible, though they may be clinically relevant given the patientâ€™s presentation.
