The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the right knee joint. Notably, there appears to be an area of radiolucency adjacent to the distal femur, which may suggest the presence of a bone cyst or a pathological process affecting the underlying bone structure. Additionally, there are signs indicative of joint effusion, characterized by a subtle outline of the suprapatellar bursa, which could indicate synovial inflammation or other intra-articular conditions.
