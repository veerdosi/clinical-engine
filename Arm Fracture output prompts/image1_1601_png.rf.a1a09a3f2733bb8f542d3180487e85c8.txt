The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger characterized by a visible disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is evident soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, suggesting the presence of hematoma and potential ligamentous involvement. No signs of joint effusion or additional bony abnormalities are noted in the adjacent structures.
