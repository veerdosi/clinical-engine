The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left wrist, showing a potential fracture in the distal radius with surgical fixation hardware in place. The presence of an intra-articular fracture line may indicate involvement of the wrist joint, suggesting possible complications such as post-traumatic arthritis. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues and the appearance of the fracture may suggest signs of edema or hematoma formation in the region.
