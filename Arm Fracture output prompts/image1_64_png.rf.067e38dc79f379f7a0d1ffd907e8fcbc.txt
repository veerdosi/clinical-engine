The provided X-ray image displays the right knee joint in an anteroposterior view, showing the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula. There is notable joint effusion evident by the increased radiolucency around the knee, which may suggest the presence of synovitis or an underlying inflammatory process. Additionally, there are signs of osteophyte formation around the femoral condyles, indicating potential osteoarthritis in the joint.
