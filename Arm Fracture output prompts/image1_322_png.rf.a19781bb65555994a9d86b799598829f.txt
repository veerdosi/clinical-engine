The X-ray image reveals a distinct fracture in the distal radius and ulna, characterized by displacement and possible angulation. There is also evidence of adjacent soft tissue edema, indicative of a potential hematoma formation that often accompanies traumatic injuries. The integrity of the articular surface of the wrist joint appears unaffected, which is important for potential healing and functional recovery.
