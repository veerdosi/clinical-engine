The X-ray reveals a lateral view of the right wrist and hand, demonstrating normal bone structure with identifiable carpal and metacarpal bones. There is apparent alignment of the distal radius and ulna, with no evidence of fractures or dislocations noted. However, slight joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint may suggest potential early degenerative changes or osteoarthritis impacting the articulation between the radius and the carpal bones.
