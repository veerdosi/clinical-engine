The X-ray image reveals a skeletal view of the wrist, displaying evidence of an internal fixation device, likely a plate and screws, which suggests a history of surgical intervention due to a fracture in the distal radius or ulna. There is notable periosteal reaction surrounding the implant, indicating possible bone healing or adaptive response to the surgical procedures performed. Additionally, the alignment appears acceptable, with no visible malunion or significant displacement of the bone fragments present.
