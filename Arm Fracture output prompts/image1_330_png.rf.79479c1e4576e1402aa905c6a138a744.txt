The X-ray image depicts the left arm in a lateral view, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a notable angular deformity observed in the diaphysis of the radius, suggesting the presence of a malunion or a possible fracture. Additionally, the joint spaces, particularly the elbow, appear normal without any signs of effusion, indicating the absence of acute inflammatory changes.
