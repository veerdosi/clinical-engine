The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulnar bones, exhibiting a notable displacement at the wrist joint. There is evidence of a fracture near the distal end of the radius, characterized by an irregular fracture line and possible accompanying periosteal reaction. Additionally, joint alignment appears compromised, indicating instability which may suggest a more complex injury such as an intra-articular fracture.

In the adjacent X-ray views, there is heightened soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate an acute inflammatory response. The carpal bones show no apparent dislocation; however, careful evaluation is necessary to rule out any occult fractures within this region. Overall, the presentation is indicative of a wrist injury, necessitating further assessment and management to address the underlying pathology.
