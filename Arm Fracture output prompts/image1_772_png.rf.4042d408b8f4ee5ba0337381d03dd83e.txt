The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the forearm, featuring a metallic implant, indicative of internal fixation through plate osteosynthesis. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radial bone, characterized by irregular cortex discontinuity and periosteal reaction. Surrounding soft tissue appears intact without signs of significant edema or hematoma, suggesting a stable postoperative condition following the fracture repair.
