The X-ray image shows the knee joint, including the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella. There is a noticeable presence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency surrounding the joint space, which may suggest acute or chronic inflammatory processes. Additionally, there are signs of bone integrity, with no evident fractures or dislocations noted in the visualized structures.
