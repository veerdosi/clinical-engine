The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the forearm, particularly highlighting the radius and ulna. There is notable displacement of the distal radius, indicative of a potential distal radius fracture, commonly associated with a Colles' fracture characterized by dorsal angulation and impaction of the fracture segment. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion in the wrist area, which may suggest inflammatory changes or associated soft tissue injury.
