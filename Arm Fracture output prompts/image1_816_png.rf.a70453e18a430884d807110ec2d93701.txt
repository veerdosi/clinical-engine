The X-ray image reveals an upper extremity, prominently displaying the radius and ulna. There is noticeable angulation and possible cortical disruption in the mid-shaft of the radius, suggesting a potential fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal and metacarpal bones appears compromised, indicating a possible fracture-dislocation at the wrist joint.
