The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of a human hand, demonstrating the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of an arcuate deformity at the proximal phalanx of the index finger, suggesting a possible case of malunion or nonunion. Additionally, there is a decreased joint space at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, which may indicate early arthritic changes or degenerative joint disease.
