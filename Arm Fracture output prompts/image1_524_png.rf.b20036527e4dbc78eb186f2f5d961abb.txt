The provided X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the left wrist and distal forearm, showing the carpal bones, distal radius, and ulna. There is evidence of an acute fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by a loss of normal cortical continuity and a displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling around the injury site, which could indicate associated hematoma formation.
