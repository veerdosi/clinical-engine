The X-ray image reveals an anterior-posterior view of the left forearm, displaying the radius and ulna. There is a notable fracture present, observed in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a complete break with angulation. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling may be inferred, suggesting possible associated contusion or hematoma formation in the surrounding area.
