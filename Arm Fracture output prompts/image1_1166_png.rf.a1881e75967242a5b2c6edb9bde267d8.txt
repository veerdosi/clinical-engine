The X-ray image exhibits a distal humerus fracture, characterized by a transverse rupture involving the metaphyseal region. There is associated joint effusion evident in the elbow joint, which may indicate soft tissue injury or intra-articular bleeding. Additionally, the alignment of the forearm bones is disrupted, suggesting possible complications such as malunion or nonunion if not properly addressed.
