The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and displacement noted at the fracture site. Additionally, there appear to be signs of potential soft tissue swelling around the region, which can indicate underlying hemorrhage or contusion. The anatomical alignment of the metacarpals appears preserved, and the distal interphalangeal joint is intact, indicating that the injury is localized to the fifth digit.
