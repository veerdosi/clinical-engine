The X-ray image demonstrates the glenohumeral joint, with notable evidence of degenerative changes, suggestive of osteoarthritis. There is a narrowing of the joint space accompanied by subchondral sclerosis, indicative of cartilage degradation. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation is observed around the joint margins, reflecting a potential chronic inflammatory process affecting the shoulder region.
