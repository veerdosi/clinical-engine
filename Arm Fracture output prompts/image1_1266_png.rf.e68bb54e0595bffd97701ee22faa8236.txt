The x-ray image displays a right shoulder joint, illustrating the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is evidence of degenerative changes, indicated by joint space narrowing and potential subchondral sclerosis, suggestive of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be soft tissue swelling or calcification adjacent to the joint, possibly indicating tendinopathy or impingement syndrome.
