The X-ray image displays the phalangeal bones of the right hand, particularly the second and third digits. There is evidence of potential bony deformities, which may indicate conditions such as malalignment or previous fractures, with some degree of periosteal reaction observed along the diaphysis of the involved bones. Joint spaces appear preserved, but any notable signs of osteoarthritis or changes in subarticular bone density are not evident from this view.
