The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulnar structures of a right wrist. Notably, there is a pronounced cortical disruption indicative of a possible fracture, particularly at the distal end of the radius, which may suggest instability in the osseous integrity. The surrounding soft tissue may show edema or hematoma, consistent with acute trauma; however, the specific characteristics of any accompanying soft tissue injury are not discernible on the radiograph.
