The X-ray image displays the full length of the left femur and tibia, with the distal aspect of the femur and the proximal aspect of the tibia clearly visible. There is a notable deformity characterized by a mild bowing of the tibial diaphysis, which may indicate underlying conditions such as tibia vara. Additionally, there is a faint radiolucent line at the mid-shaft of the tibia that could signify a stress fracture or incomplete fracture formation.
