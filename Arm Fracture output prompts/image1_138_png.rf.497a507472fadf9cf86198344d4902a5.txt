The radiograph demonstrates a right hand (R) with a clear view of the phalangeal structures. There is evidence of a displaced fracture observed in the proximal phalanx of the thumb, accompanied by possible angulation deformity. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be indicated around the fracture site, suggesting an acute inflammatory response.
