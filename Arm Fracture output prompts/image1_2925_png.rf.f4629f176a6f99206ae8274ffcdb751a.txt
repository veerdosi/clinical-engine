The radiograph demonstrates an oblique view of the shoulder joint, revealing an anatomical abnormality associated with the acromioclavicular joint. There is evident dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint, characterized by the inferior displacement of the distal clavicle relative to the acromion process. Additionally, signs of subacromial edema are observed, which may suggest secondary impingement or rotator cuff involvement.
