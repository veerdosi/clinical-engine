The X-ray image depicts the right wrist joint with an oblique view of the distal radius and the proximal row of carpal bones. There is evidence of a potential scaphoid fracture characterized by a discontinuity in the silhouette of the bone, which may suggest an acute injury. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears slightly altered, indicating possible ligamentous injury or instability within the carpal structures.
