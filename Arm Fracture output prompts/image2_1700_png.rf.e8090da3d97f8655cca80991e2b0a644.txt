The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left forearm, which includes the radius and ulna bones. There is a visible deformity characterized by an angular displacement of the bone structure, indicative of a possible fracture, with hematoma or soft tissue swelling likely adjacent to the injury site. The image also suggests the presence of a splint, which is typically utilized to immobilize the affected area and promote healing in after a fracture or acute injury.
