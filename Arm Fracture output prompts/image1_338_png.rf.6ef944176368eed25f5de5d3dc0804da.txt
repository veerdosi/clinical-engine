The X-ray image displays a right forearm, including the radius and ulna, with the hand and wrist visible. There is notable cortical disruption in the midshaft region of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture. Additionally, evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site may suggest an associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
