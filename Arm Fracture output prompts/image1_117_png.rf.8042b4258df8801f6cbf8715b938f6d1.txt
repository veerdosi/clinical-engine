The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna. There is notable cortical thinning and a focal area of radiolucency near the midshaft of the radius, suggestive of a possible pathological process such as osteomyelitis or a benign bone lesion. Additionally, subtle periosteal reaction is observed, which may indicate an inflammatory or neoplastic condition affecting the bone structure.
