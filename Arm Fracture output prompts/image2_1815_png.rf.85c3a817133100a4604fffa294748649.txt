The X-ray image reveals a right forearm with notable radiolucent lines indicating fractures in both the radius and ulnar shafts. There appears to be a degree of angular deformity at the fracture sites, suggesting possible malalignment during the healing process. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident, which may indicate associated trauma around the bone injury.
