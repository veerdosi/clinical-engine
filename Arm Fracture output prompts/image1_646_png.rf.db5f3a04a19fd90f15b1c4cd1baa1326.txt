The x-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of a human hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable in the image is the presence of a malalignment of one or more proximal phalanges, suggesting potential deformity or dislocation. Additionally, there may be evidence of joint space narrowing, which could indicate degenerative changes or inflammatory processes affecting the hand's function.
