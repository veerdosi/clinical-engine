The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures. There is evidence of degenerative changes, potentially suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there may be an indication of rotator cuff pathology with potential cuff tear, identified by irregularities in the proximal humerus and altered alignment of the acromion.
