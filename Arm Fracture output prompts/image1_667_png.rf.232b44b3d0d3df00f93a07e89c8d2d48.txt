The X-ray shows a lateral view of the right shoulder, with significant emphasis on the humeral head and glenohumeral joint region. There is noticeable joint effusion and potential subacromial impingement, characterized by the proximity of the humeral head to the acromion process, which may indicate rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the appearance of the proximal humerus suggests potential avascular necrosis, evidenced by areas of altered density in the bone structure.
