The X-ray image displays an anterior-posterior view of the left knee joint, revealing the proximal tibia and distal femur. There is evidence of a possible fracture involving the tibial plateau, indicated by irregularities in the cortical bone and a discontinuity in the trabecular pattern. Additionally, there may be joint effusion, as suggested by the soft tissue swelling around the knee, which can be indicative of underlying trauma or hematoma.
