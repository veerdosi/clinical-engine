The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing a significant displacement of the radial head. There is an apparent fracture line traversing the radial neck, suggesting a type of injury commonly seen in pediatric patients known as a "nursemaid's elbow." Additionally, the alignment of the olecranon appears normal, with no signs of associated joint effusion or osteophyte formation.
