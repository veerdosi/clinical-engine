The image displays an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna. There is evidence of malalignment present in the distal radial and ulnar areas, which may indicate a potential fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there is notable soft tissue swelling adjacent to the bone structures, suggestive of an inflammatory response or hematoma formation.
