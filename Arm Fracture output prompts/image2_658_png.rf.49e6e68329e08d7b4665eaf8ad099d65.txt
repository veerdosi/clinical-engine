The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left humerus, where a surgical plate is applied. Notable is the presence of an intramedullary device along with associated screws, indicating prior intervention likely due to a fracture. The surrounding bony architecture appears intact, but there is potential callus formation indicative of the healing process at the site of previous trauma.
