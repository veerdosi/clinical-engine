The X-ray demonstrates the right knee joint with surgical hardware, specifically a plate and screws, indicative of internal fixation. There is evidence of a prior fracture involving the distal femur and proximal tibia, characterized by irregular bony contours. The alignment of the joint appears stable, but there may be associated post-surgical changes such as callus formation or mild joint effusion not distinctly visualized in this projection.
