The X-ray image presents the left shoulder joint, specifically revealing the glenohumeral joint's structure. Notable findings include the presence of a potential proximal humeral fracture, indicated by irregular cortical margins and displacement of the humeral head. Additionally, there appears to be signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint, which may suggest associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
