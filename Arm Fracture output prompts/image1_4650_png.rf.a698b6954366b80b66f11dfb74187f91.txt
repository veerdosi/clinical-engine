The X-ray image presents evidence of a fracture in one of the digits of the left hand, characterized by a discontinuity in the bony cortex. There is also noticeable misalignment of the fracture fragments, suggesting a displaced fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the fracture site may indicate associated hematoma formation or inflammatory response.
