The X-ray image exhibits a lateral view of the right elbow joint, demonstrating significant osteophyte formation around the joint, indicative of osteoarthritis. There is also evidence of joint space narrowing, which can suggest degenerative changes in the articular cartilage. Notably, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is observed, further supporting the diagnosis of chronic degenerative joint disease affecting the elbow region.
