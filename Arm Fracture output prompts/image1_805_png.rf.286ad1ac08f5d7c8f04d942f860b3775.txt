The X-ray image depicts the right knee joint, showing both femoral and tibial bone structures. There is a notable presence of a sharp lucency traversing the proximal tibia, indicating a possible fracture or fracture line. Additionally, minor joint effusion may be inferred from the perception of soft tissue shadowing around the knee, suggesting associated intra-articular pathology.
