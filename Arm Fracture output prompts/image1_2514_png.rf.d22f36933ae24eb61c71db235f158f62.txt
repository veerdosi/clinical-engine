The X-ray image displays the radiographic appearance of the right wrist, highlighting the distal radius and ulna, as well as the carpal bones. Notably, there is a cortical discontinuity along the distal radius, which may indicate a fracture or fracture lines, characterized by radiolucent zones surrounding the area of concern. Soft tissue swelling may also be observed in the periarticular region, suggesting the presence of an inflammatory process associated with trauma or a possible occult fracture.
