The X-ray image demonstrates a left humerus with the presence of an intramedullary nail, indicating a surgical intervention for stabilization, commonly used in cases of complex fractures. Notably, there is an evident callus formation at the fracture site, suggesting an ongoing healing process following surgical treatment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be apparent around the surgical site, which can be indicative of surrounding inflammation or post-operative edema.
