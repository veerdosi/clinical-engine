The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder area, where a notable radiolucency is observed in the proximal humerus, suggesting a potential bone lesion. Additionally, the glenohumeral joint appears to have abnormal alignment, indicative of possible dislocation or joint instability. Surrounding soft tissue edema may be present, indicating an inflammatory or traumatic process affecting the shoulder region.
