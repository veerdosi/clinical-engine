The X-ray image demonstrates an orthopedic fixation device, specifically a plate and screws, that is used to stabilize a fracture in the distal radius or ulna of the forearm. There is evidence of a fracture in the bone, indicated by displacement and irregularity in the bone's contour. The presence of metallic hardware suggests that surgical intervention for fracture stabilization has been performed, reflecting the management of a significant bony injury.
