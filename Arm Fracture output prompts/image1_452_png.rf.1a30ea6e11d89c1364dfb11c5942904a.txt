The X-ray image presented shows a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna. There is notable deformity in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a transverse fracture with potential displacement, indicating a need for further evaluation. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, which typically suggests associated hematoma formation.
