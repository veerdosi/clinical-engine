The X-ray image displays the left hand, with clear visualization of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is evident joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation at the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may indicate possible osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is a lack of uniformity in bone density, suggesting potential subchondral bone changes consistent with degenerative joint disease.
