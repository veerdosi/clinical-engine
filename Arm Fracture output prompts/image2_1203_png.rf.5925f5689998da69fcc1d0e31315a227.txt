The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing a possible effusion in the joint space. There appears to be a prominent osseous irregularity, suggestive of a potential fracture or avulsion injury along the lateral aspect of the distal humerus. Additionally, the alignment of the radial head may indicate a dislocation or subluxation relative to the proximal radius.
