The X-ray image of the right hand displays a standard radiographic view, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. The presence of any potential fractures, dislocations, or signs of arthritis in the joint spaces should be evaluated, particularly notable in the carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints. Additionally, the alignment and integrity of the bones should be assessed for any deformities or signs indicative of osteoporosis or other degenerative conditions.
