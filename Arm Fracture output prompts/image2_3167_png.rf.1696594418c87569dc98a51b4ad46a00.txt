The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right shoulder joint, clearly showing the humeral head articulating with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Notable is the presence of a large osteophyte formation, indicative of joint degeneration, likely secondary to osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is evidence of potential subacromial impingement characterized by a reduction in the acromiohumeral interval.
