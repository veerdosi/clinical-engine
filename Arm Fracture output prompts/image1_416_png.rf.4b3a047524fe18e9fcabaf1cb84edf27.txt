The X-ray image displays the phalanges of a left hand, specifically focusing on the proximal and middle phalanges of the second digit. There is evidence of possible malalignment and a fracture visible in the distal phalanx, indicating a disruption in the normal anatomical integrity of the digit. There is also potential evidence of osteopenia in the surrounding cortical bone, which could suggest decreased bone density.
