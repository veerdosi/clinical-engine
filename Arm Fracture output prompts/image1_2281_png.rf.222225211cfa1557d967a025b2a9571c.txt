The X-ray image displays a right wrist joint with an identifiable radiopaque foreign body, suggestive of surgical fixation, likely indicating prior intervention for a fracture. Notably, there is also evidence of potential displacement of the distal radius and ulna, which may reflect an acute or chronic fracture pattern. Additionally, periarticular soft tissue swelling can be inferred from the altered bone contours, indicating possible inflammatory processes or trauma-related changes.
