The X-ray image reveals a proximal humeral fracture characterized by a disruption of the bony continuity in the region of the humeral head. There is notable displacement of the fracture fragments, which may indicate instability in the fracture pattern. Additionally, signs of potential avascular necrosis may be observed in the subchondral region of the humeral head, as well as changes in the surrounding soft tissue.
