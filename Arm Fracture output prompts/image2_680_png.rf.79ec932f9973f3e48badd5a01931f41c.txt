The X-ray depicts an anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) view of the left forearm, which includes the radius and ulna. There is notable angulation and possible displacement at the mid-shaft of the radius, indicative of a potential fracture or deformity. Additionally, the joint spaces appear intact with no evident signs of arthritic changes or edema surrounding the bone structures.
