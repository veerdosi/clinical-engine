The X-ray image depicts the left elbow in a lateral view, revealing notable radiolucency around the olecranon process. There is an apparent effusion in the joint space, indicated by the accumulation of fluid, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process such as bursitis or synovitis. Additionally, the presence of any irregularities in the joint surface or periarticular bone could be indicative of potential degenerative changes or trauma-related lesions.
