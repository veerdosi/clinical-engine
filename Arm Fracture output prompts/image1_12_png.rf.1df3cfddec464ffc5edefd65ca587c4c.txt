The X-ray depicts the right shoulder joint, showcasing the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is noticeable joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation around the glenohumeral joint, indicating possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of cortical irregularities at the proximal humerus suggests a possible osteolytic lesion or subchondral cyst formation, warranting further clinical correlation for differential diagnosis.
