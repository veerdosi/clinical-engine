The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the right hand, with a particular focus on the phalangeal bones of the digit. Notable findings include signs of a potential fracture in the proximal phalanx, characterized by a cortical disruption and possible misalignment of the bone segment. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, which may suggest an associated contusion or inflammatory response.
