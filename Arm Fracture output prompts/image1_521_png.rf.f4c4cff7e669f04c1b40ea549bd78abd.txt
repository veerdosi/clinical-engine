The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint in a lateral view, highlighting the humeroulnar and humeroradial articulations. Notable in the image is the presence of a joint effusion, evidenced by increased radiolucency in the region surrounding the olecranon fossa. Furthermore, there appears to be irregularity at the capitellum, which may suggest osteochondral changes or early signs of osteoarthritis.
