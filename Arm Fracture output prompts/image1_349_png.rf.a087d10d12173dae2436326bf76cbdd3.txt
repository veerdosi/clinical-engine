The provided X-ray image demonstrates the right knee joint and distal femur, indicating a potential fracture involving the femoral condyles. There is notable joint effusion, suggesting the presence of synovial fluid accumulation, which could indicate underlying pathology. Additionally, alignment of the knee appears disturbed, raising suspicion for possible ligamentous injury or post-traumatic deformity.
