The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal ulna, with emphasis on the elbow joint. Notable is the presence of a well-defined radiolucent area near the olecranon fossa, which may suggest an osteochondral defect or a possible fracture. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion as indicated by potential soft tissue swelling surrounding the structures, which could be associated with inflammatory processes or trauma.
