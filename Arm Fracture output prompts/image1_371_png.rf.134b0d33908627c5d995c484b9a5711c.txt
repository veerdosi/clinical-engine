The X-ray image presents the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula with clear visualization of the joint space. Notably, there is an irregularity in the joint line, suggestive of potential osteoarthritis or meniscal pathology, characterized by joint space narrowing and possible subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there may be evidence of periarticular soft tissue swelling, which could indicate an inflammatory process or a prior trauma.
