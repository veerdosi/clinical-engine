The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, with particular emphasis on the glenohumeral joint and surrounding bony structures. Notable findings include potential signs of degenerative changes in the humeral head, possibly indicative of osteoarthritis, and possible subacromial impingement patterns observed around the acromion. Additionally, a lack of smooth articulation between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity may suggest underlying pathologies such as labral tears or rotator cuff pathology.
