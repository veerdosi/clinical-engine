The X-ray image reveals the distal phalanges of the fingers, exhibiting normal bony architecture without any signs of acute fractures or dislocations. However, there is a notable presence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the proximal interphalangeal joints, which could indicate an inflammatory process such as tenosynovitis or arthritis. Additionally, minor joint space narrowing is observed, which may suggest early degenerative changes, potentially consistent with osteoarthritis.
