The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint in a lateral view. Notable findings include an abnormal alignment of the ulna and radius relative to the humerus, suggesting a possible cubitus varus deformity, commonly referred to as "gunstock deformity." Additionally, there may be evidence of joint effusion, indicated by soft tissue swelling around the olecranon fossa, which could suggest underlying inflammatory or traumatic processes.
