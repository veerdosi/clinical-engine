The X-ray image displays the right elbow joint, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notable findings include potential signs of joint effusion and osteophyte formation, which may indicate underlying degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis. The alignment of the elbow appears intact, but there is a clear loss of subarticular bone density, suggestive of possible inflammatory changes or chronic joint stress.
