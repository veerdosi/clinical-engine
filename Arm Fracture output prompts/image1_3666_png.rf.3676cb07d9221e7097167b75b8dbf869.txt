The X-ray image shows an oblique view of the right hand, displaying the phalanges and metacarpal bones. There is evidence of potential malalignment and soft tissue swelling around the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may suggest an inflammatory condition. Additionally, there is a possible fracture of the middle phalanx, indicated by a discontinuity in the cortices and associated bone edema.
