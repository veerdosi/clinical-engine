The X-ray image displays an anterior view of the left shoulder joint, revealing significant degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Notable evidence of joint space narrowing and subacromial spurring is observed, indicative of potential impingement syndrome. Additionally, the presence of a possible rotator cuff tear may be suggested due to irregularities at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, warranting further evaluation.
