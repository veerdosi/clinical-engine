The X-ray image demonstrates the right elbow joint in an anteroposterior view, showing clear delineation of the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is a suspicion of an osteophyte formation at the olecranon region, which may indicate osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, joint space narrowing is present, potentially suggesting accompanying synovitis or inflammatory changes within the joint.
