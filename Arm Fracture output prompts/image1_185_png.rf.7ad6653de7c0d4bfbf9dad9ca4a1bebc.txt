The X-ray image demonstrates a radiographic view of the distal humerus and proximal forearm, highlighting the alignment and integrity of the bone structure. The examination reveals a possible fracture line across the shaft of the radius, which may indicate a recent traumatic injury. Additionally, there is an observed displacement of the fracture fragments, suggesting a more complex injury that may require further orthopedic evaluation and management.
