The X-ray image depicted shows a lateral view of the ankle joint, with a prominent delineation of the tibia and fibula. There is evidence of an oblique fracture in the distal fibula, characterized by an incomplete cortical breach, and adjacent soft tissue swelling is noted, suggesting possible contusion or hematoma formation. Additionally, there is joint effusion in the ankle joint, indicated by increased radiolucency surrounding the joint space.
