The X-ray image presents the right knee in the anteroposterior view, revealing the joint alignment and bony structures. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion, as indicated by the increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, suggesting potential pathology such as bursitis or synovitis. The presence of osteophytes along the margins of the femur and tibia is indicative of degenerative joint disease, commonly associated with osteoarthritis.
