The image presents an anteroposterior (AP) X-ray view of the hand, specifically highlighting the phalanges of the thumb. Notably, there is an observable angulation at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, suggesting possible subluxation or dislocation. Additionally, there is evidence of osteopenia, indicated by the decreased radiopacity of the bone structures, which may correlate with underlying metabolic bone disease.
