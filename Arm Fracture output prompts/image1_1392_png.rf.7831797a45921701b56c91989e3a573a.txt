The X-ray image reveals a left forearm with a visible mid-shaft fracture of the radius, evidenced by a disruption in the cortical continuity of the bone. There is the presence of internal fixation hardware, including screws and a plate, indicating prior surgical intervention for stabilization of the fracture. Additionally, there is notable soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest an associated hematoma or inflammation.
