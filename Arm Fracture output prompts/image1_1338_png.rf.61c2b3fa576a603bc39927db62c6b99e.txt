The image presents an anterior-posterior view of the left shoulder, demonstrating the proximal humerus and glenoid fossa. There is evidence of potential degenerative changes, including subchondral sclerosis and joint space narrowing, which may indicate osteoarthritis. Additionally, possible avascular necrosis of the humeral head is suggested due to the presence of irregularities in bone contour and density.
