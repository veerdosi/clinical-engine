The X-ray image displays the left humerus, showcasing its anatomical structure in relation to the shoulder and elbow joints. Notable radiological findings include the alignment of the humeral head and the presence of any potential avulsion injury or fracture line in the surrounding soft tissues, especially in the proximal region. The overall architecture of the bone appears intact, but the integrity of the nearby joint structures should be assessed for possible signs of rotator cuff pathology or joint effusion.
