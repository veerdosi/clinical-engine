The X-ray image depicts a distal radius fracture, characterized by the presence of metallic fixation devices, indicating prior surgical intervention. The alignment of the distal radius appears compromised, with evidence of a displaced fracture that has been stabilized with a plate and screws. Additionally, there is an observable callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process in the bone.
