The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left hand and forearm, illustrating the phalanges, metacarpals, and portions of the distal radius and ulna. Examination reveals the presence of potential osteophyte formation at the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggestive of possible osteoarthritis. In addition, there is a notable alignment discrepancy indicating possible malunion or dislocation of the first metacarpal with respect to the carpometacarpal joint.
