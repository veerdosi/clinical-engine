The radiograph presents a lateral view of the knee joint, showing normal anatomical structures including the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is notable narrowing of the joint space, which can indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Additionally, there may be evidence of subchondral sclerosis or osteophyte formation around the articulating surfaces, which are typical radiographic findings associated with chronic joint pathology.
