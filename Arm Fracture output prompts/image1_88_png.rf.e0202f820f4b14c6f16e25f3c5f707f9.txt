The radiographic image depicts the proximal and distal regions of the right wrist and hand, demonstrating the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notable in the image is the presence of a scaphoid fracture, indicated by a discontinuity in the cortical outlines of the scaphoid bone, which is critical in wrist stability and function. Additionally, there are signs of avascular necrosis in the lunate bone, characterized by radiolucency and a change in bone density that may suggest impaired blood supply.
