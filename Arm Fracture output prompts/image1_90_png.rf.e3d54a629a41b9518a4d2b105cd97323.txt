The X-ray image displays the right forearm, prominently featuring the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the ulna, characterized by a disruption of cortical continuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the radius appears normal without any visible fractures or deformities.

The deformity indicates a possible radial/ulnar fracture pattern, which may require further assessment for associated injuries. The alignment of the distal and proximal segments should be closely examined for any malunion or displacement. Radiological inspection also excludes any acute pathological conditions, such as osteomyelitis or malignancy, in the visible bone structures.
