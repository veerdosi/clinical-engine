The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the humerus and the elbow joint, revealing a notable fracture in the mid-shaft region of the humerus. There is evident displacement of the fracture fragments, which may suggest a diaphyseal fracture pattern. Additionally, minor signs of periosteal reaction may be visible around the fracture site, indicating an inflammatory response to the injury.
