The X-ray depicts the left hand, showing evidence of potential bony deformities in the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is a pronounced misalignment of the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggesting the presence of possible arthritis or a previous injury. Additionally, the joint spaces appear narrowed, which may indicate degenerative joint disease affecting the handâ€™s functional capacity.
