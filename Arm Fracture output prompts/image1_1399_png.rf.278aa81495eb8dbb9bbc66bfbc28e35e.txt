The X-ray image of the shoulder joint demonstrates an apparent reduction in the joint space between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity, suggestive of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The presence of subchondral sclerosis and possible osteophyte formation around the joint margins indicates chronic degenerative changes. Additionally, there is a noted irregularity in the morphology of the humeral head, which may be indicative of a previous anatomical deformity or post-traumatic sequela.
