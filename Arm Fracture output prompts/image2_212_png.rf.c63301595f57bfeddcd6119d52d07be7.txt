The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, indicating the presence of an orthopedic plate with multiple screws, suggesting a prior surgical intervention for a fracture stabilization. There is evidence of cortical bone continuity around the implanted hardware, though the alignment of the bones may be noted for any malunion or nonunion assessment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling or any signs of callus formation are not discernible in this radiograph, which may warrant further evaluation of the healing process.
