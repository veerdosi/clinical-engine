The image displays an X-ray of the right shoulder joint, highlighting the anatomical structures, including the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and acromion. Notable is an irregularity in the cortical bone of the proximal humerus, which may suggest a potential fracture or metabolic bone disorder. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, possibly indicating the presence of degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis.
