The X-ray image demonstrates the right knee joint in an anteroposterior view, depicting clear visibility of the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and fibula. There is noticeable narrowing of the joint space, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by degenerative changes in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Additionally, the image shows no acute fractures or dislocations, but hypertrophic bone changes around the joint may indicate chronic stress or degenerative processes.
