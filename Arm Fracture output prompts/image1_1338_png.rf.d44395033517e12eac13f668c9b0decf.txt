The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and proximal humerus. There appears to be evidence of degenerative changes, potentially consistent with osteoarthritis, as indicated by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are signs of possible rotator cuff pathology, such as calcific deposit formation or variations in the contour of the greater tuberosity.
