The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left forearm, showcasing the proximal and distal segments of the radius and ulna bones. Notable is a distinct fracture line observed in the midshaft of the radial bone, which appears displaced with possible angulation, indicating the presence of a diaphyseal fracture. Additionally, there is a subtle periosteal reaction along the ulnar shaft, suggesting potential underlying pathology, such as a stress fracture or early signs of osteomyelitis.
