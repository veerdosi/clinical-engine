The X-ray image depicts the right hand, focusing on the phalangeal anatomy of the thumb. There is evidence of malalignment of the proximal phalanx, suggestive of a possible fracture or dislocation at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Additionally, there are signs of periosteal reaction around the base of the metacarpal, which may indicate underlying pathology such as osteomyelitis or trauma-related changes.
