The X-ray image displays the anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views of the distal forearm, revealing both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a visible fracture of the distal radius, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and potential angulation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed around the fracture site, suggesting an associated injury or inflammatory process.
