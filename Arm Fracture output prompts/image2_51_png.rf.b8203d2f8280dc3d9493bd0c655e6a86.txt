The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal alignment of the humerus, indicating a potential dislocation or fracture of the shoulder joint. There is notable subluxation of the glenohumeral joint, characterized by the displacement of the humeral head from its normal anatomical position. Additionally, osseous irregularities or signs of soft tissue edema may be observed surrounding the joint, suggesting acute inflammatory changes.
