The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the humerus, demonstrating the presence of a metallic internal fixation device, indicative of surgical intervention for a humeral fracture. The alignment of the bone appears to be restored, as reflected by the position of the fracture fragments, which are stabilized via the fixation hardware. There is possible cortical irregularity and callus formation around the fracture site, suggestive of the healing process following an orthopedic procedure.
