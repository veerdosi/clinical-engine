The X-ray image shows a clear view of the left wrist, specifically focusing on the distal radius and ulnar bones, along with the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a notable alignment of the carpals, but the radial fracture presents with a slight dorsal angulation at the distal radius, indicative of possible acute injury. Additionally, there is early evidence of osteopenia in the surrounding bony structures, which may suggest reduced bone density in the affected area.
