The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, with the humeral head articulating with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Notably, there is a visible fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone continuity and possible displacement. Additionally, there is some periosteal reaction observed, which may indicate an underlying inflammatory process or a response to trauma in the surrounding soft tissues.
