The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the forearm, showcasing both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a complete fracture of the radius with significant displacement, as well as a contusion along the ulna, indicative of possible associated soft tissue injury. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear edematous, suggesting a localized inflammatory response, which may accompany the fracture.
