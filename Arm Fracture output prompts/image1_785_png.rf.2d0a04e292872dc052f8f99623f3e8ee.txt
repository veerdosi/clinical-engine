The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus and glenohumeral joint, showcasing subluxation of the humeral head with respect to the glenoid cavity, indicative of potential shoulder instability. The visualization reveals associated soft tissue swelling and may suggest rotator cuff pathology, particularly if there are concomitant soft tissue injuries. Furthermore, there are signs of possible osseous changes that could signal degenerative joint disease in the shoulder region.
