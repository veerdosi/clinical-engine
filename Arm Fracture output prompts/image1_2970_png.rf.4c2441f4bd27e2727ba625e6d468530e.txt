The X-ray image presented shows an oblique view of the left humerus, revealing a fracture in the mid-shaft region accompanied by noticeable callus formation indicative of a healing process. The presence of intramedullary fixation devices suggests prior surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture. Additionally, there are signs of possible adjacent soft tissue edema, which may be attributed to the acute inflammatory response related to the traumatic injury.
