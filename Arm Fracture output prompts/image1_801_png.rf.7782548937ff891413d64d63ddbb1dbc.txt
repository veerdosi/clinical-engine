The X-ray image displays the left shoulder region, prominently revealing the presence of surgical hardware, likely indicating a recent orthopedic intervention.

The surrounding soft tissues exhibit no significant signs of acute edema or calcification, but residual shadows may indicate prior trauma or degenerative changes.
