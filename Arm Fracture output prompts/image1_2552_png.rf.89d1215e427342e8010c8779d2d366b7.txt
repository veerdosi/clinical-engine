The X-ray image depicts a right elbow joint with an implanted fixation device, suggesting a previous surgical intervention, which may indicate the presence of a fracture requiring stabilization. Notably, the alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna appears altered, which could signify malunion or a residual deformity from a prior injury. Surrounding soft tissue may present signs of edema or changes consistent with post-operative healing, although no soft tissue abnormalities are explicitly visible on this image.
