The X-ray image depicts the distal phalanx of the fifth digit exhibiting a transverse fracture characterized by a cortical disruption. There is also notable periosteal reaction surrounding the fracture site, indicating a possible acute injury. Alignment between the fractured segments appears compromised, potentially revealing a displacement phenomenon.
