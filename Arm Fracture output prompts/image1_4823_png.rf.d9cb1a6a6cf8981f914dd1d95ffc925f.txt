The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the left hand, highlighting the phalangeal bones of the digit. Notably, there is the presence of a metallic implant or fixation device situated across a fracture site within the proximal phalanx, indicative of a previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Additionally, there is a possible malalignment or displacement of the fractured bone ends, suggesting a post-traumatic change that may require further evaluation for healing progression and functional recovery.
