The X-ray image displays a sagittal view of the left femur, illustrating a notable area of cortical thinning indicative of osteopenia. There is a well-defined radiolucent line suggesting a non-displaced fracture through the midshaft of the femur, consistent with a stress fracture. Additionally, the presence of metallic hardware indicates a history of previous surgical intervention, likely related to fracture fixation or correction of an alignment deformity.
