The radiographic images depict the left wrist and hand, demonstrating notable anatomical structures such as the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling in the periarticular regions, suggesting possible inflammation or trauma. Additionally, alignment of the carpal bones shows potential irregularities, which may indicate an underlying deformity or prior injury, necessitating further clinical correlation.
