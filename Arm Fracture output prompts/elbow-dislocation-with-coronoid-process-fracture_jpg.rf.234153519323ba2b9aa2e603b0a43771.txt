The X-ray image demonstrates a well-defined area of cortical bone loss in the distal femur, near the knee joint. There are signs of potential osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing and the presence of subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are prominent osteophyte formations at the medial aspect of the joint, suggesting chronic degenerative changes.
