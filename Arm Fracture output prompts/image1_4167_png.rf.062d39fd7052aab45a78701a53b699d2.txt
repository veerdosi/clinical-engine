The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the distal humerus with visible hardware, indicating a previous surgical intervention, likely involving internal fixation. Notable is the presence of an external fixator mechanism, which suggests a complex fracture previously sustained in the region. There are signs of callus formation around the surgical site, indicative of the healing process post-fracture stabilization.
