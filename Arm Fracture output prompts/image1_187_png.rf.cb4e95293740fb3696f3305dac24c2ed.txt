The radiograph depicts the skeletal structure of a right hand, focusing primarily on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is an apparent angulation observed in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, which may indicate a possible dislocation or fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling in the surrounding areas of the digit suggests the presence of inflammation consistent with acute trauma or injury.
