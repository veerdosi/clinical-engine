The X-ray image reveals a visible fracture of the radius in the forearm, which is characterized by a radiolucent line indicative of a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggesting the presence of associated hematoma or inflammation. Additionally, the alignment of the distal segment appears to be angulated, which may indicate a possible malalignment of the fracture.
