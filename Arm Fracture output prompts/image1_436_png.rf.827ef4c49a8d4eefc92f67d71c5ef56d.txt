The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and a clear alignment of the fracture line. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area, potentially indicative of an accompanying hematoma. Additionally, the ulnar alignment appears normal without any signs of lateral displacement or additional osseous abnormalities.
