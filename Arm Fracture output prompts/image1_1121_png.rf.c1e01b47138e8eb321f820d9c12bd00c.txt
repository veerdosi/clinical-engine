The X-ray image demonstrates a right wrist joint with distinct visibility of the carpal bones, distal radius, and distal ulna. Notable is the presence of osteophytes at the joint margins, which may indicate degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis. Additionally, there is possible joint space narrowing, suggesting advanced arthritic changes in the articulating surfaces.
