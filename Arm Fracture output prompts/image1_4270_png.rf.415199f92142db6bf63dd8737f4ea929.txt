The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the hand, particularly focusing on the phalanges of the fifth digit (little finger). Notable is the presence of a bony prominence or malalignment at the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting the possibility of a dislocation or fracture leading to post-traumatic deformity. Additionally, there may be signs of osteophytic changes at the distal interphalangeal joint, indicating early degenerative changes or osteoarthritis.
