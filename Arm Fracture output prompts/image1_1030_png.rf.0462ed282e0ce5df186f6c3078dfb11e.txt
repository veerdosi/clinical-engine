The X-ray image displays a hand in an anteroposterior view, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a potential distal radius fracture, characterized by a break in the continuity of the bone cortex, which may indicate acute trauma. Additionally, the soft tissue contours surround the wrist and hand appear normal, with no signs of effusion or significant edema visible on the radiograph.
