The X-ray image shows the left shoulder joint in a lateral view, demonstrating the acromion, humeral head, and glenoid fossa. There is evidence of degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, indicative of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of a prominent bone spur at the acromion suggests the possibility of impingement syndrome affecting the rotator cuff tendons.
