The image depicts an X-ray of the left arm, clearly showing signs of a fracture in the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by a noticeable disruption in the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, the presence of an intramedullary fixation device indicates prior surgical intervention, suggesting management of the fracture. There is evidence of potential callus formation around the fracture site, which may indicate the healing process in progress.
