The X-ray image demonstrates a right elbow joint in a slightly flexed position, revealing the alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a noteworthy radiolucent area suggestive of a possible fracture or lesion at the distal humerus, which warrants further evaluation. Additionally, the cortical bone integrity appears compromised, indicating potential pathologies such as osteopenia or other underlying bone disorders.
