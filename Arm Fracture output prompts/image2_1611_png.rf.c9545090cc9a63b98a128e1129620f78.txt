The X-ray image displays the left lower limb, including both the tibia and fibula, with notable changes in bone structure. There is a noticeable fracture in the distal fibula, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity and surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, signs of potential malalignment can be observed at the site of the fracture, indicating a possible unstable injury that may affect the ankle joint's integrity.
