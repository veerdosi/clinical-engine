The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and ulna with visible alignment and articulations present in the wrist and hand. There is notable osteopenia in the carpal bones, which may suggest an underlying metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis, or a previous injury if correlated with clinical history. Additionally, the image shows a possible fracture line through the distal radius, with displacement indicating a fracture with potential instability, warranting further evaluation.
