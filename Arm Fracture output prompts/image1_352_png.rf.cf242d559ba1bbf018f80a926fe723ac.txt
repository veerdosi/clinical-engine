The image depicts a radiograph of the forearm, specifically showcasing both the radius and ulna. There is notable cortical disruption indicating a potential fracture in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by an abrupt break in the bone continuity. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture site appears edematous, which may suggest an accompanying hematoma formation.
