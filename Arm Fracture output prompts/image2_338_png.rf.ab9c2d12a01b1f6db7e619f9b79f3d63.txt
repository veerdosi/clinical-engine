The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the distal femur, revealing the presence of an intramedullary nail stabilized with multiple cortical screws. There is evidence of a previous fracture in the region, as indicated by the alignment of the bone and the hardware placement. Signs of callus formation adjacent to the fracture site suggest a healing response, but further evaluation may be necessary to assess the completeness of the union and the potential for any complications.
