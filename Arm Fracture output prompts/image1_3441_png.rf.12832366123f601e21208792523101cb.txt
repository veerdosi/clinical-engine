The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, illustrating the anatomy including the scapula, humerus, and proximal clavicle. There is a notable irregularity in the glenoid cavity, which may suggest degenerative changes or possible osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing. Additionally, there is a potential presence of a bone spur or osteophyte formation at the acromion, which could indicate impingement syndrome or rotator cuff pathology.
