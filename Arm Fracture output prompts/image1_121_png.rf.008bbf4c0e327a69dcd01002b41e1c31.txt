The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left leg, prominently displaying the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notably, there is an observable misalignment in the angulation of the tibia, suggesting a potential malunion or deformity. Additionally, cortical bone integrity appears compromised, indicating possible underlying pathologies such as stress fractures or osteopenia.
