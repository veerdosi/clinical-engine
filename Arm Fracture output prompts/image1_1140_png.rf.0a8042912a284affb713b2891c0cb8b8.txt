The image displays an X-ray of the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal joints and the metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of possible oblique fractures in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, characterized by altered alignment and irregular cortical outlines. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident in the dorsal aspect, suggestive of associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
