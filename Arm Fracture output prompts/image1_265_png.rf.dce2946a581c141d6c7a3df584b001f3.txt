The X-ray image presents an angular deformity of the distal radius, characterized by a malunion post-fracture. There is evident presence of metal fixation devices, indicating a previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Additionally, signs of potential non-union at the fracture site are observed, which may complicate the healing process.
