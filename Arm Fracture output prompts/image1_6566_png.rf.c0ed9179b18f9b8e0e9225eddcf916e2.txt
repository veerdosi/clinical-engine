The X-ray image shows an anterior view of the right elbow, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is evidence of radiolucency around the olecranon fossa, suggesting possible osteolytic lesions that may indicate underlying pathology. Additionally, there appears to be joint effusion, which may be associated with inflammatory or traumatic conditions affecting the elbow joint.
