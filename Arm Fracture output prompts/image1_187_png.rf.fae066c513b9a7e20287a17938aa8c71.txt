The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius with associated swelling evident around the fracture site, indicative of soft tissue injury. There is moderate angulation of the fracture, suggesting instability that may require further intervention for alignment. Additionally, the image reveals potential involvement of the ulnar styloid process, which could indicate an acute wrist injury potentially affecting the carpal joint alignment.
