The X-ray image presents the right elbow joint, where evidence of orthopedic intervention is visible. An internal fixation device, including a plate and screws, is prominently located along the ulna and distal humerus, indicating surgical management of a fracture.

Notable is the presence of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting ongoing healing. Additionally, there is a lack of alignment in the articular surface of the joint, which may indicate malunion or complications from the initial injury.
