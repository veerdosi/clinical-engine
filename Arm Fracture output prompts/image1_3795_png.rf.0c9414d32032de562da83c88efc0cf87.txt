The X-ray radiograph displays the anatomy of the right hand, showing the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a notable fracture visible in one of the metacarpal bones, characterized by a non-displaced cortical break with associated interference in the alignment of the bone. Additionally, there is evidence of potential soft tissue swelling around the injury site, suggesting an acute traumatic event.

The radiographic projection indicates that the fracture is located near the base of the metacarpal, which is indicative of a common location for such injuries. The phalangeal structures appear intact, without any signs of malalignment or dislocation. Furthermore, there is no evidence of degenerative changes or osteolytic lesions in the surrounding bony structures, indicating the absence of chronic pathology in this specific view.
