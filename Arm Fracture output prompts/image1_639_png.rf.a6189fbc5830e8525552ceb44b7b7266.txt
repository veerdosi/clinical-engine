The X-ray image reveals a notable deformity in the right lower limb, specifically at the tibia and fibula junction. There is evidence of a potential pathological process, characterized by an irregular bony structure suggesting a possible osteogenic mass. Additionally, joint incongruence is observed at the ankle, which may indicate underlying arthritic changes or previous traumatic events.
