The radiographic image demonstrates an anteroposterior view of the left humerus and distal arm. Notably, there is an angular deformity of the humerus, suggestive of a possible osteolytic lesion or skeletal dysplasia. The joint spaces, including the elbow joint, appear preserved, with no acute fractures or dislocations evident in the surrounding bony structures.
