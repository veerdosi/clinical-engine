The image displays an anteroposterior and lateral view of the left wrist, where multiple carpal and metacarpal bones are visible. Notably, there is significant alignment irregularity and possible overlapping of the scaphoid and lunate bones, which may suggest a carpal dislocation or scaphoid fracture. The presence of soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint indicates potential inflammation or trauma to the surrounding structures.
