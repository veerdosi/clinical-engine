The X-ray image reveals a significant fracture of the scaphoid bone located in the anatomical snuffbox area, which is critical for wrist stability and function. There is also evidence of displacement, indicating a possible non-union risk associated with this type of fracture. Additionally, signs of osteonecrosis may develop over time if blood supply to the scaphoid is compromised, necessitating close monitoring and potential intervention.
