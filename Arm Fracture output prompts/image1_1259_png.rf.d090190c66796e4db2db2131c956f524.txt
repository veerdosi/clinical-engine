The X-ray demonstrates an abnormality in the proximal humerus, specifically at the humeral head region. There appears to be evidence of a possible humeral head avascular necrosis, characterized by subchondral bone collapse and lucency surrounding the affected area. Additionally, the joint space between the humeral head and the glenoid cavity suggests potential arthritic changes, indicated by a reduction in articular cartilage thickness.
