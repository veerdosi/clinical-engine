The X-ray image displays the right humerus, with particular emphasis on the diaphysis and proximal epiphysis. There is a notable presence of an aberrant radiolucency indicative of a bone lesion, which could suggest potential pathological changes such as a cyst or a neoplasm. Additionally, there is a mild cortical irregularity along the mid-shaft, raising the possibility of a periosteal reaction or underlying inflammatory process.
