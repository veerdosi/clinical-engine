The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the left thumb, with particular attention to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Notably, there appears to be a pronounced angulation at the distal phalanx, suggesting a possible condition such as a malunion or a fracture deformity. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling around the joint may indicate inflammation or a traumatic process impacting the surrounding anatomical structures.
