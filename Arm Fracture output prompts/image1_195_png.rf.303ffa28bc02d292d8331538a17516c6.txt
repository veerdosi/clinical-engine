The X-ray image of the knee joint demonstrates an abnormal alignment and irregularity in the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia, suggestive of possible osteoarthritis. There is notable joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, which are indicative of degenerative changes often seen in chronic joint conditions. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes can be noted around the joint margins, further confirming the diagnosis of osteoarthritic changes in this region.
