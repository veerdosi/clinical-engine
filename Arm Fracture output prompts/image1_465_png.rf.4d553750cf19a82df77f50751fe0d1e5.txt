The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left shoulder, revealing a potential fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. There is observable displacement or angulation at the fracture site, indicating a possible instability in the upper limb. Soft tissue swelling around the joint may suggest associated hematoma or inflammation, which is commonly observed in acute traumatic injuries.
