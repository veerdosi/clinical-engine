The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder complex, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures. There is a notable presence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency in the joint space, which may suggest underlying pathology such as arthritis or tendinopathy. Additionally, the acromion and surrounding soft tissue show signs of potential degenerative changes, characterized by irregular cortical margins and possible subacromial impingement.
