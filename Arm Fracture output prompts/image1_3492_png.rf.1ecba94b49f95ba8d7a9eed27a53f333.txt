The X-ray image depicts the right hand in a lateral view, focusing on the first metacarpal and the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. There is notable joint space narrowing at the carpometacarpal joint, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by potential subchondral sclerosis or joint effusion. Additionally, the phalangeal contours appear normal, with no visible fractures or dislocations.
