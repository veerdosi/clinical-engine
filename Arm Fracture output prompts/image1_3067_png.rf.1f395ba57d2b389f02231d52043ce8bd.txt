The X-ray image reveals a right wrist exhibiting the presence of internal fixation devices, specifically plates and screws, which indicate previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. There is evidence of multiple comminuted fractures at both the distal radius and ulna, characterized by fragmentation of the bone structure. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is likely surrounding the fracture site, suggesting an inflammatory response consistent with post-traumatic injury.
