The X-ray images depict the skeletal structure of a hand, highlighting the phalangeal bones, metacarpals, and associated joints. Notable findings include the presence of subluxation at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the 2nd digit, indicating potential instability or joint dislocation. Additionally, there is a possible malalignment of the 3rd digit, which may suggest an underlying condition such as a fracture or degenerative joint disease.
