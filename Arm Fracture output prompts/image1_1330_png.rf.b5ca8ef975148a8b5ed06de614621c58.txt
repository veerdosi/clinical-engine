The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing a clear view of the distal radius and ulnar structures. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture at the distal radius with potential involvement of the ulnar styloid process, characterized by cortical disruption and periosteal reaction. Additionally, the joint spaces of the wrist and carpals appear intact, indicating no significant dislocation, while soft tissue swelling around the fracture site may suggest an associated soft tissue injury.
