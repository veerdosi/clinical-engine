The X-ray image shows the right shoulder (indicated by "R") with clear visualization of the glenohumeral joint, the humeral head, and the acromioclavicular joint. There is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, which may suggest impingement syndrome or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, slight irregularity or changes in the contour of the acromion are noted, which could indicate structural abnormalities such as acromial spur formation.
