The X-ray image demonstrates the bony structures of the right hand, with particular emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpals of the index finger. There is a noticeable angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate a possible fracture or dislocation of the proximal phalanx. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred around the affected area, suggesting an inflammatory process or trauma.
