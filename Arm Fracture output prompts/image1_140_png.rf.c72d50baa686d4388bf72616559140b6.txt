The X-ray demonstrates a mildly displaced fracture of the humeral diaphysis, with evidence of cortical disruption and periosteal reaction. Additionally, there is blunting of the glenoid cavity, suggesting potential involvement of the shoulder joint. Surrounding soft tissue shows signs of edema, which may indicate associated hematoma formation or inflammatory response.
