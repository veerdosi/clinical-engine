The image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, highlighting the humeroulnar and humeroradial articulations. Notably, there appears to be an osseous irregularity at the medial aspect of the elbow, which may suggest the presence of an osteophyte formation or other degenerative changes. Additionally, the joint space shows signs of narrowing, indicative of potential arthritic changes or joint effusion affecting the normal anatomical alignment and integrity of the elbow.
