The X-ray image of the right knee joint depicts abnormal findings consistent with a decrease in joint space, indicative of possible osteoarthritis. The presence of subchondral sclerosis suggests underlying degenerative changes in the articular cartilage, which may lead to pain and functional impairment. Additionally, the formation of osteophytes around the joint margin is observed, further supporting the diagnosis of degenerative joint disease.
