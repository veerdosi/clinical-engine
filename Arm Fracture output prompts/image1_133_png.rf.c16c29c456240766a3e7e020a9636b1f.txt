The X-ray image depicts the right humerus, showing signs of a malunion at the mid-shaft with irregular cortical thickness. There is notable callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a prior fracture healing process, which may indicate a history of fracture-related complications. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue appears to have reactive changes, potentially pointing to inflammation associated with the healing humerus.
