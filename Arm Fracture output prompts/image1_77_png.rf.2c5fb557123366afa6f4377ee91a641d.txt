The X-ray image demonstrates the proximal and middle phalanges of the right index and middle fingers, with the bony architecture appearing intact. There is an observable deformity with a notable angular displacement of the proximal phalanx, suggesting a possible fracture or martial injury. Soft tissue swelling may also be present, indicating the potential for soft tissue interstitial fluid accumulation associated with the underlying bony pathology.
