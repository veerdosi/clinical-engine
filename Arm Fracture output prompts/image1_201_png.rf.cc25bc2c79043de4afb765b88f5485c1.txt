The X-ray image displays an overview of the distal forearm and wrist, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notably, there appears to be evidence of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical outline and a misalignment of the bony fragments. Additionally, there is possible soft tissue swelling noted adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate associated hematoma or inflammatory response.
