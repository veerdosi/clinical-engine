The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, showing a significant deviation from normal anatomical alignment, indicative of a potential deformity or fracture.

Additionally, the clear involvement of the soft tissues adjacent to the involved bone raises suspicion for possible hematoma formation or inflammation.
