The X-ray depicts the left knee joint, showing the presence of a metallic implant consistent with a total knee arthroplasty. There is evident degeneration of the femoral and tibial articular surfaces, which may suggest underlying osteoarthritis or post-traumatic changes. The alignment of the implant appears to be within normal limits, and no signs of peri-implant fracture or osteolysis around the prosthesis are observed.
