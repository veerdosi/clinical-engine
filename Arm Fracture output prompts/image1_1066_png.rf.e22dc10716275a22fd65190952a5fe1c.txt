The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the left hand, showcasing several notable bony structures and joints. Noteworthy is the malalignment of the proximal phalanges, indicative of a potential previous fracture or dislocation, commonly observed in injuries to the metacarpal area. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident around the phalanges, which may suggest underlying inflammation or local trauma.

The interphalangeal joints exhibit varying degrees of angulation, with some phalanges appearing digitatively displaced. There is a possible indication of joint erosion at the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints, which could be suggestive of degenerative changes or inflammatory arthritis. The presence of any associated osteophytes or bone sclerosis should be further evaluated to assess for chronic pathological conditions.
