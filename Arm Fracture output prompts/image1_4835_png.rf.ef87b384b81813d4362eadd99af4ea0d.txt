The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the right hand, specifically focusing on the second digit, which appears to be in a flexed position. There is an observable angulation of the proximal phalanx, suggestive of a potential deformity or fracture, likely involving the metacarpophalangeal joint. Additionally, there are signs of possible malalignment at the distal interphalangeal joint, indicating a possible ligamentous injury or joint instability.
