The X-ray depicts a left wrist with the presence of surgical hardware, indicative of a previous fracture repair or stabilization procedure. Notably, there is an observable fracture line within the distal radius, suggesting a history of trauma, and the alignment of the bony structures appears compromised. Additionally, there is evidence of osseous callus formation surrounding the fracture site, indicating the process of bone healing post-injury.
