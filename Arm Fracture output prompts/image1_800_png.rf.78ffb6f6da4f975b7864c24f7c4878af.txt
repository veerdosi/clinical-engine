The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the humerus and proximal radius, revealing a notable deformity located in the mid-shaft region of the humerus. There is evidence of a potentially displaced fracture, characterized by abnormal alignment and cortical disruption. Additionally, there may be accompanying soft tissue swelling, which could indicate periosteal reaction or hematoma formation adjacent to the injury site.
