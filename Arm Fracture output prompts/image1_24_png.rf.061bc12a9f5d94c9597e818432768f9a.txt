The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right hand, with clear visual representation of the metacarpals and phalanges. The phalangeal alignment appears to reveal a possible malrotation or angulation, which could indicate a deformity in the digit. Additionally, there is potential evidence of a previous fracture in one of the metacarpals, suggested by cortical disruption and altered trabecular patterns in the adjoining bony structures.
