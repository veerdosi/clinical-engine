The image shows an X-ray of the left humerus, revealing a pronounced diaphyseal fracture characterized by angular displacement and possible comminution. Notable is the presence of surrounding periosteal reaction, indicating subacute to chronic injury and potential inflammation in the surrounding soft tissue. Additionally, there appears to be a significant radiolucent line at the fracture site, suggesting a loss of continuity in the cortical bone structure, which is indicative of fracture non-union or delayed healing.
