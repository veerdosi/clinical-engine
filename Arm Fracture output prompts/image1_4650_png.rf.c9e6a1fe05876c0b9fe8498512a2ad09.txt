The X-ray image depicts the left hand in a posterior-anterior view, showcasing various bony structures of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is a visible fracture in the proximal phalanx of one of the digits, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and accompanying soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicative of a potential malunion or misalignment that may require further assessment or intervention.
