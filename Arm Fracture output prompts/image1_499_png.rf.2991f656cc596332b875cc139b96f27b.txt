The X-ray demonstrates a left hand in a standard anteroposterior (AP) view, displaying several bony structures including the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notable findings include an angulated fracture of the distal phalanx of the ring finger, indicative of a potential traumatic injury. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion in the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting possible inflammatory or degenerative changes such as arthritis.
