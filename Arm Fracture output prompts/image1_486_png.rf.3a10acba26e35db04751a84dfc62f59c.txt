The X-ray reveals a clear articulation of the carpal bones, with particular attention to the scaphoid and lunate bones. Notably, there is evidence of potential degenerative changes in the radiocarpal joint, which may present as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, an abnormality in the bone density of the surrounding structures could indicate osteopenia or early osteoarthritis, warranting further clinical correlation.
