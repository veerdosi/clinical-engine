The X-ray image presented shows the left forearm, with clear visualization of both the radius and ulna. Notable findings include an angular deformity in the mid-shaft region of the ulna, which appears to be related to a possible osteogenic condition, such as a fracture or stress-related change. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, and there is no evident sign of acute fractures or dislocations in the wrist or elbow joints.
