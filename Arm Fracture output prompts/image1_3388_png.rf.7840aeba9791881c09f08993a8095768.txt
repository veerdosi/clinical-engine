The X-ray image depicts the right hand and forearm, showcasing the skeletal structure including the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notably, there is evidence of an abnormal alignment of the distal phalanges, which may suggest the presence of a post-traumatic deformity or an underlying arthritic condition. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the bones appears to be of normal density, with no significant signs of edema or bony lesions identified in this view.
