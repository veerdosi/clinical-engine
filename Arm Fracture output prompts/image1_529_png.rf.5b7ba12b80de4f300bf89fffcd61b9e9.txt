The X-ray presents an image of the right lower limb, primarily focusing on the femur, tibia, and fibula. Notable is the presence of abnormal alignment at the knee joint, suggesting potential malalignment or an underlying deformity. Additionally, there appears to be a concerning area of radiolucency along the diaphysis of the tibia, which may indicate a possible fracture, osteolytic lesion, or stress reaction that warrants further investigation.
