The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right elbow joint, clearly showing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of joint effusion and a possible fracture line in the radial head, indicating a potential acute injury. Additionally, the alignment of the bony structures appears compromised, suggesting the presence of valgus deformity at the elbow, which may contribute to instability in the joint.
