The X-ray image displays the right lower extremity, highlighting the tibia and fibula in a lateral view. There is a notable focal area of radiolucency indicated by a fracture line, suggesting a possible fracture of the mid-shaft of the tibia, which is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the fibula appears intact but is in close proximity to the fracture site, raising concern for associated injuries in periosteal integrity.
