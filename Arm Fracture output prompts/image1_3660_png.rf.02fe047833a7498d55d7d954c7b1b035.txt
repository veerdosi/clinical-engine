The X-ray image reveals a notable radiolucent lesion within the proximal phalanx of the second digit, which may suggest the presence of a bone cyst or a benign tumor. Surrounding the lesion, the cortical bone appears intact without significant cortical destruction, indicating a possible non-aggressive nature of the lesion. Additionally, the alignment of the metacarpophalangeal joint is preserved, with no signs of acute fracture or dislocation evident in the surrounding bony structures.
