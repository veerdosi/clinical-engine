The x-ray image of the forearm reveals an alignment discrepancy between the radius and ulna, suggesting a possible angular deformity. There is evidence of cortical bone irregularity, which may indicate prior trauma or pathology affecting the osseous structure. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed adjacent to the distal radius, potentially indicative of a soft tissue injury or inflammation.
