The X-ray image shows an anterior view of the right shoulder joint, highlighting the acromioclavicular joint and the proximal humerus. There is an apparent abnormality in the alignment of the acromion and clavicle, suggestive of a possible acromioclavicular joint separation or instability. Additionally, the proximal humerus appears to be displaced, indicating a potential fracture or dislocation of the shoulder joint.
