The X-ray image of the left knee joint reveals a significant effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, which may suggest joint inflammation or trauma. Additionally, there are signs of bone contusion along the distal femur and proximal tibia, characterized by irregularities in the cortices, which may indicate underlying trauma or stress response. The alignment of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau appears intact, but further examination may be warranted to rule out any associated fractures or soft tissue injuries.
