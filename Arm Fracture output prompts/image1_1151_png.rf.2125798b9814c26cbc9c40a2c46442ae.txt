The X-ray image presents multiple views of the left hand, with notable emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpals. There appears to be an alignment deviation of the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may suggest a potential case of digital deformity or malalignment. Additionally, the visual assessment indicates possible signs of osteopenia, given the reduced bone density observed in the metacarpal region, warranting further evaluation for underlying conditions.
