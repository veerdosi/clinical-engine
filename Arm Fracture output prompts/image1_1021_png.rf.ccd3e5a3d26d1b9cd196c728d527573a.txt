The X-ray image illustrates the proximal humerus, showing a distinct fracture line indicative of a surgical neck fracture. There is also notable displacement and angulation of the fragments, which is characteristic of this type of injury. Surrounding soft tissue may display edema suggesting possible soft tissue compromise or contusion associated with the fracture.
