The X-ray image reveals the right upper extremity, specifically highlighting the humerus and associated anatomical structures. Notable findings include a possible fracture of the proximal humerus, which appears displaced and exhibits a disruption of the cortical outline. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicative of an acute inflammatory response.
