The X-ray image displays a right forearm, including a view of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Notable in the image is the presence of a distinct deformity, characterized by an angulated fracture through the mid-shaft of the radial bone, indicating a possible acute fracture involving displacement. Additionally, there is an observable effusion around the elbow joint, which may suggest an associated injury or joint pathology concurrent with the fracture.
