The X-ray image depicts the shoulder joint, specifically the glenohumeral joint, with notable changes in the alignment of the humeral head. There is evidence of possible glenohumeral instability, characterized by dislocation or subluxation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema or injury, indicating potential rotator cuff pathology or bursa inflammation.
