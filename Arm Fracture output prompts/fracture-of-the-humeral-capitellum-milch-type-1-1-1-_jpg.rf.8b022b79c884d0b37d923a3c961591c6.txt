The x-ray image reveals the left elbow joint, showcasing an abnormal joint space and differential bone density in the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. There is evidence of osteophyte formation around the joint margins, indicative of osteoarthritis, which may contribute to reduced range of motion and pain. Additionally, there is joint effusion noted in the region, potentially signifying inflammatory processes, which may warrant further clinical evaluation.
