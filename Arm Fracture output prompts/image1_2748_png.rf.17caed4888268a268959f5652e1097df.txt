The X-ray image displays a left hand in an anteroposterior projection, illustrating the bones of the metacarpals and phalanges. There is an abnormal angulation noted at the proximal interphalangeal joint, indicative of a potential malalignment or fracture deformity. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed surrounding the affected digits, raising suspicion for an associated soft tissue injury or inflammatory process.
