The X-ray image depicts the wrist joint, highlighting the distal radius and the carpal bones. Notably, there is a visible deformity characterized by the presence of a fracture line through the distal radius, which may indicate an acute injury. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears altered, suggesting potential dislocation or subluxation in conjunction with the fracture.
