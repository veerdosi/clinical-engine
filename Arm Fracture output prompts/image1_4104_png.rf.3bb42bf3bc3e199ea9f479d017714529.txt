The X-ray image reveals a fracture of the distal phalanx of the right hand, characterized by an oblique fracture line. There is the presence of metallic fixation devices, indicating previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Additionally, there are signs of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process is underway, although the alignment appears slightly displaced.
