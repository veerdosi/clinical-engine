The X-ray image demonstrates a notable deformity in the distal femur region, characterized by a significant angular deformity and possible malalignment of the bone structures. A foreign object is visible within the intramedullary canal, suggesting a potential pathological condition that may require further investigation. Additionally, there is the presence of heterotopic ossification adjacent to the joint surfaces, which may indicate a reactive process in response to trauma or surgical intervention.
