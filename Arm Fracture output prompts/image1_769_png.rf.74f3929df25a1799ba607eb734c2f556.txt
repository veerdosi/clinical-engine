The X-ray image depicts the left upper extremity, clearly showing the humerus, scapula, and proximal regions of the forearm. Notably, there is evidence of a possible deformity or malalignment, particularly at the shoulder joint, which may suggest rotator cuff involvement or other shoulder pathology. Additionally, there is an assessment of the surrounding soft tissue structures, which may demonstrate signs of swelling or effusion indicative of an underlying inflammatory process.
