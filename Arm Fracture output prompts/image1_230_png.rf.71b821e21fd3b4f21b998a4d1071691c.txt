The X-ray of the right wrist depicts multiple carpal and metacarpal bones, including the scaphoid and trapezium, clearly delineating their anatomical configurations. Notably, there is evidence of an abnormal bony density suggestive of a possible osteolytic lesion, which may indicate underlying pathology such as a benign or malignant neoplasm. Additionally, joint spaces appear preserved, but there may be soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected regions, possibly indicating an inflammatory process or traumatic etiology.
