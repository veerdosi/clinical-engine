The X-ray image depicts a left shoulder showing a significant surgical implant, likely indicative of a previous shoulder arthroplasty or fixation procedure. The presence of metallic hardware, characterized by a plate and screws, suggests a stabilization mechanism employed for fracture fixation or joint reconstruction. Additionally, there may be signs of osseous changes surrounding the implant, which could indicate potential complications such as periprosthetic bone loss or osteolysis, but no clear assessment can be made without further clinical correlation.
