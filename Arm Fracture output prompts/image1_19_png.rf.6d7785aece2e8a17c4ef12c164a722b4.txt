The X-ray image depicts the proximal radius and ulna of the forearm, with a notable presence of an intramedullary fixation device, suggesting prior surgical intervention or stabilization. There is evidence of callus formation surrounding a previous fracture site, indicating the healing process of the bone. Additionally, no acute fractures or dislocations are observed in the surrounding soft tissue, which appears unremarkable.
