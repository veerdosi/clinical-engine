The radiograph depicts a lateral view of the left elbow, showing an orthopedic construct, likely a plate fixation, applied to stabilize a fracture. The presence of metallic hardware suggests the management of a significant skeletal injury, possibly involving the distal humerus or proximal ulna. Additionally, there is evidence of joint effusion in the surrounding soft tissues, which may indicate inflammatory changes associated with the underlying pathology.
