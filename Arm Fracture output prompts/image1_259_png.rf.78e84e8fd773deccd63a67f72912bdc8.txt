The X-ray demonstrates the humerus and the proximal structures of the arm, revealing a potential fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. There is evident callus formation indicative of a healing process, suggesting the presence of an osteoporotic condition or potential pathologic fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the glenohumeral joint appears compromised, which may signify associated ligamentous or soft tissue injury.
