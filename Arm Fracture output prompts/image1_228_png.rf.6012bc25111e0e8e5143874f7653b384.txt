The X-ray image demonstrates a right forearm with visible signs of a potential fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone continuity. There is evidence of displacement at the fracture site, indicating a possible angulation deformity of the distal segment. Additionally, soft tissue swelling surrounding the area may suggest associated hematoma or inflammation.
