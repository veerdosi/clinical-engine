The X-ray image demonstrates a right forearm with visible alignments of the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a comminuted fracture at the distal radius with multiple fracture lines present, indicating complex bone injury. Additionally, the soft tissue around the fracture site appears edematous, suggesting potential hematoma formation associated with the traumatic event.
