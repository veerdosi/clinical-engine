The X-ray demonstrates a right forearm with notable abnormalities. There is a visible fracture evident in the radial body, characterized by a transverse displacement at the site of the break. Additionally, the alignment of the distal ulna appears compromised, suggesting possible associated ligamentous injury or instability in the forearm complex.
