The X-ray image displays the right lower leg, including the tibia and fibula, demonstrating a noteworthy deformity in the distal segment of the fibula. There is an observable angulation and potential misalignment at the fracture site, indicating a possible fracture with malunion or non-union characteristics. Additionally, the cortical bone appears irregular in thickness, suggesting underlying issues such as osteopenia or previous trauma.
