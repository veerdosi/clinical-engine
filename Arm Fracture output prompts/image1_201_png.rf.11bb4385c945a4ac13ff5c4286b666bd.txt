The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the knee joint with clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. There appears to be an angular deformity at the tibial diaphysis, which may suggest a malalignment or reorientation of the bone structure. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, indicating potential degenerative changes or early signs of osteoarthritis affecting the knee joint.
