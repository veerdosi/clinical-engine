The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the humerus and shoulder joint, revealing potential abnormalities in the proximal humerus. There is evidence of a possible fracture or bony irregularity in the surgical neck of the humerus, which may indicate a traumatic injury. Additionally, the relationship between the humeral head and glenoid fossa should be evaluated for any signs of dislocation or degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis, which can impact joint health and function.
