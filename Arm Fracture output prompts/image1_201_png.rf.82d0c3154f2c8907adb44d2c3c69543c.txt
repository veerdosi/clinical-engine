The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing the radius and ulna in anatomic alignment. Notably, there is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the bone cortex with associated edema in the surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, the distal radial head appears intact, indicating that there is no immediate dislocation or associated injury to the proximal ulna.
