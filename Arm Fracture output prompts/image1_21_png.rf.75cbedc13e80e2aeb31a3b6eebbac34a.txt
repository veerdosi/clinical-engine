The X-ray image presented shows a left wrist in an anteroposterior view, revealing the carpal and metacarpal bones, as well as the proximal phalanges of the fingers. Notable observations include possible signs of avascular necrosis in the scaphoid bone and a potential fracture line through the distal radius, indicating a possible disruption of the bone cortex. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint, which may suggest underlying pathological conditions such as inflammation or hematoma formation.
