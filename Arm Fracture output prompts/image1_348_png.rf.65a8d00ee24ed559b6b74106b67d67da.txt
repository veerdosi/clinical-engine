The X-ray image displays the right knee joint, revealing clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of potential joint effusion, characterized by increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, suggesting the presence of fluid accumulation. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, which may indicate the possibility of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease affecting the knee articulation.
