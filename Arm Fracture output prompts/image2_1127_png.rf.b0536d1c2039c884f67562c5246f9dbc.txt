The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna in alignment. Notably, there is a clear indication of a possible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the bone cortex and potential displacement. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues exhibit signs of edema, which may suggest an inflammatory response secondary to the underlying bony injury.
