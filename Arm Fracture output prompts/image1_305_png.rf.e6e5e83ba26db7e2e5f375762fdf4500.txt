The X-ray illustrates a lateral view of the wrist, revealing a possible dorsal angulation of the distal radius, which may indicate a fracture. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact; however, the radio-carpal joint is obscured, warranting further examination for any potential joint effusion or associated injuries. There is a notable disruption in the cortical continuity of the radius, suggesting the presence of a fracture line that may require further assessment for displacement or instability.
