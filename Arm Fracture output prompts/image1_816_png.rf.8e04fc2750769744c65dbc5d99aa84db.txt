The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint with a clear view of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Notably, there is an irregularity in the bone structure surrounding the ulna's olecranon process, which may suggest a potential avulsion fracture or bony prominence. Additionally, the joint space appears slightly narrowed, indicating a possibility of degenerative changes or joint pathology.
