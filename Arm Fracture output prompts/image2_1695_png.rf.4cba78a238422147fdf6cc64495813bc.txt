The X-ray image depicts the radius and ulna in the forearm, showing significant displacement of the distal radius, consistent with a fracture. The cortical bone integrity appears compromised in the region of the fracture, indicating a possible acute traumatic injury. Additionally, there is potential angulation of the distal segment of the radius, suggestive of a potential malunion if not properly treated.
