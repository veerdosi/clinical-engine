The X-ray image demonstrates a longitudinal view of the forearm, exhibiting the radiocarpal joint and surrounding structures. Notable radiographic findings include potential abnormal alignment or spacing between the carpal bones, which may suggest a diagnosis of carpal instability or a previous trauma such as a fracture. The absence of significant osteopenia and the integrity of the ulnar and radial shafts suggest a non-acute process, but additional clinical correlation is necessary to assess any underlying pathologies.
