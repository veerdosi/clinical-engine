The X-ray image displays the bones of the left wrist, showing a potential fracture of the distal radius with associated soft tissue swelling. There is an evident misalignment at the wrist joint, suggesting possible malunion or subluxation. Additionally, the visualization of the carpal bones exhibits irregularities that may indicate arthritic changes or avascular necrosis in the lunate.
