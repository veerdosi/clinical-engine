The X-ray image demonstrates a joint profile of the knee with clear visualization of the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by a potential increase in soft tissue density surrounding the joint cavity, which may suggest underlying inflammation. Additionally, there is irregularity noted at the articular surfaces, possibly indicating osteoarthritis or chondromalacia, characterized by degeneration of the cartilage.
