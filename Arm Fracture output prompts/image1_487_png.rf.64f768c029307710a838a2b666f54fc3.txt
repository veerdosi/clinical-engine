The X-ray reveals an oblique view of the left elbow joint, demonstrating the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulna. Notably, there is significant joint effusion observed in the olecranon recess, indicating potential synovitis or acute inflammation within the joint space. Additionally, there is a visible cortical irregularity along the lateral condyle of the humerus, which may suggest a fracture or osteochondral defect requiring further evaluation.
