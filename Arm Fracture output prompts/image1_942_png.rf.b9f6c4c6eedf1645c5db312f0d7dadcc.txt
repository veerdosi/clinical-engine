The X-ray shows the left shoulder with a visible and prominent subacromial space, indicating potential issues with the rotator cuff. There is evidence of a bony irregularity at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may suggest a prior fracture or degenerative changes. Additionally, calcific tendinitis may be inferred due to the presence of mineralization in the soft tissue adjacent to the humeral head, potentially indicating chronic inflammation or shoulder impingement syndrome.
