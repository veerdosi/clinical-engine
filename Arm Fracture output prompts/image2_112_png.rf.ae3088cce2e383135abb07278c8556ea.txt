The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by a transverse displacement. Notably, the presence of hardware through intramedullary nailing is evident, indicating previous surgical intervention for fracture stabilization. Additionally, signs of callus formation are visualized along the fracture site, suggesting a healing process following the orthopedic procedure.
