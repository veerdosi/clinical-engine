The X-ray depicts the humerus and its proximal articulations, revealing potential signs of a fracture or other bony irregularities. There appears to be a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone at the distal humerus, which may indicate a bony lesion or fracture callus formation. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue structures show no significant edema or abnormal calcification, which is pertinent in evaluating the extent of a potential injury.
