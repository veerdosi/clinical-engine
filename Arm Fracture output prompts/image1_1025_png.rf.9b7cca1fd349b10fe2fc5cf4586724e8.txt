The X-ray image shows multiple views of the left wrist and forearm, revealing distinct anatomical structures including the radius, ulna, and carpal bones. There is observable joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint, which may indicate underlying degenerative changes or possible inflammatory conditions. Additionally, there is evidence of subtle bony irregularities along the distal radius, suggestive of potential osteochondral defects or bone stress abnormalities.
