The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the shoulder joint, with notable emphasis on the glenoid cavity and the humeral head. There is evidence of a possible joint effusion, indicated by an abnormal soft tissue shadow adjacent to the shoulder, which may suggest underlying inflammatory arthropathy or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, there appears to be an irregularity at the proximal humerus, possibly indicative of a fracture or ossification abnormality, warranting further evaluation for potential complications such as avascular necrosis.
