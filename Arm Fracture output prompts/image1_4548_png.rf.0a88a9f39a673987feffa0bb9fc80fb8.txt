The radiographic image depicts the dorsal views of both hands, prominently showcasing the metacarpal and phalangeal bones. There is observable joint space narrowing at the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggestive of potential arthritic changes. Additionally, there appears to be subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal joints, indicating possible inflammatory or degenerative joint disease requiring further clinical evaluation.
