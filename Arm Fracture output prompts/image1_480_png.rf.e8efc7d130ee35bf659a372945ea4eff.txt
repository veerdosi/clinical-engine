The X-ray of the right elbow reveals a hyperextension injury, characterized by an abnormal angulation of the joint and potential ligamentous stress. Notably, there is evidence of osseous irregularity, indicating possible osteophytic changes around the joint margins. Additionally, small radiopaque foreign bodies are visible in the soft tissue, suggesting previous trauma or surgical intervention in the area.
