The X-ray shows the distal radius and ulna, with notable joint involvement at the radiocarpal joint. There is an evident presence of a radiolucent lesion located near the distal aspect of the radius, which may suggest a pathological process, such as a cystic formation or a tumor. The overall alignment appears maintained, though further evaluation is warranted to assess the integrity of the bone cortex and surrounding soft tissue structures.
