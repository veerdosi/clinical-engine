The X-ray image depicts a right hand with a clear manifestation of a malunion or nonunion in the phalangeal bones of the fingers. There is noticeable dorsal angulation and possible flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints, indicating a disruption in the normal anatomy. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the affected digits, suggesting inflammatory changes associated with the underlying skeletal abnormalities.
