The X-ray image appears to show the left shoulder joint, demonstrating the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding anatomical structures. There is significant radiolucency noted around the acromion process, which may suggest changes associated with degenerative joint disease or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the presence of any osteophytes or subluxation cannot be definitively confirmed without further imaging or clinical correlation, but these findings may indicate potential shoulder instability or impingement syndrome.
