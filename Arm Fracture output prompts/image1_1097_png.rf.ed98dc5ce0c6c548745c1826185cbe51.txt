The X-ray image of the right hand shows visible bone structure with the presence of the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a notable presence of potential osteoarthritic changes in the carpometacarpal joints, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are signs suggestive of possible soft tissue abnormalities, which may indicate tenosynovitis or other inflammatory conditions of the wrist area.
