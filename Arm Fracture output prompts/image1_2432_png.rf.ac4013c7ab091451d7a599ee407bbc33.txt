The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the distal femur, demonstrating the presence of a metallic fixation device, indicative of an internal fixation procedure, likely due to a previous fracture. There is evidence of a healing fracture site, characterized by callus formation, suggesting a response to the surgical intervention. No acute fracture lines are evident, and the alignment of the femoral shaft appears intact, with no signs of malunion or non-union observed within the visualized area.
