The radiographic image shows a lateral view of the right hand, specifically focusing on the metacarpal bones and proximal interphalangeal joints. There is notable joint space narrowing at the base of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis. Additionally, the appearance of osteophytes at the joint margins suggests a degenerative change consistent with chronic joint pathology.
