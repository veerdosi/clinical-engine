The X-ray image depicts the left wrist, clearly showing the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by cortical breaks and possible displacement, suggesting the presence of a distal radius fracture. Additionally, there may be soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, which is indicative of an acute injury.
