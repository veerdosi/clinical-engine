The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint, demonstrating a significant irregularity in the alignment of the ulna and radius. There is evidence of osteophyte formation, suggesting possible osteoarthritis in the joint, indicated by the joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, signs of previous fracture healing can be noted, with callus formation present around the distal humerus.
