The X-ray image depicts an oblique view of the left forearm, including the distal humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable is the presence of a prominent cortical irregularity in the midshaft region of the radius, which could suggest a potential fracture or other structural compromise. Additionally, there is a slight displacement of the radial head at the elbow joint, indicating a possible associated ligamentous injury or instability.
