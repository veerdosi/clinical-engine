The X-ray image shows the distal radius and ulna, with a notable deformity at the distal end of the radius characterized by angulation and a potential fracture line. The surrounding soft tissue appears edematous, indicating possible trauma or underlying pathology. Joint spaces, particularly at the wrist, should be evaluated for any signs of effusion or misalignment, which could suggest associated ligamentous injury or instability.
