The X-ray image reveals a marked oblique fracture of the distal radius, which is notable for its angulation and associated displacement. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears maintained, although there may be signs of soft tissue swelling around the fracture site indicative of hematoma formation. No significant joint effusion or other acute osseous abnormalities are evident in the visualized structures of the wrist.
