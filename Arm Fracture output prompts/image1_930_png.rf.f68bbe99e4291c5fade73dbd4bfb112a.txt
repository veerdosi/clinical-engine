The X-ray image depicts an oblique view of the right elbow joint, showcasing metallic hardware indicating prior surgical intervention. Notable is the presence of a plate and screws applied to the distal humerus, suggesting stabilization due to a previous fracture, likely involving the lateral condyle. Additionally, there is a slight misalignment of the joint surfaces, raising the possibility of post-surgical complications such as malunion or nonunion.
