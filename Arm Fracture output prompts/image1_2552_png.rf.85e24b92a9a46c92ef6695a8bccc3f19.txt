The X-ray image displays a right elbow joint with apparent signs of surgical intervention, evidenced by the presence of metallic hardware, including screws and a plate, suggesting a fixation procedure. Notable is the visualization of a comminuted fracture of the distal humerus, characterized by multiple bone fragments, which may indicate a previous trauma requiring surgical stabilization. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no signs of significant effusion or acute inflammatory changes, consistent with post-operative imaging.
