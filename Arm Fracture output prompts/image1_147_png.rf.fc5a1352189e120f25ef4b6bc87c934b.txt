The X-ray shows a clear delineation of the shoulder joint, including the humeral head, scapula, and proximal clavicle. There is evidence of glenohumeral joint degeneration, evidenced by the presence of joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, which may suggest osteoarthritis. Additionally, the greater tuberosity of the humerus appears to show irregularities, potentially indicative of rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
