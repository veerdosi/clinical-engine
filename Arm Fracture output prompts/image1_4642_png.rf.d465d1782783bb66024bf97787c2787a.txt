The X-ray shows a longitudinal fracture of the femur, evident by the disrupted cortical bone continuity and alignment. There is the presence of internal fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, indicating that surgical intervention was performed to stabilize the fracture site. Additionally, there is possible evidence of callus formation around the fracture, which may suggest the healing process is underway despite the mechanical stabilization.
