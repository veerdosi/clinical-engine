The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the right wrist and hand, highlighting the distal radius and ulna along with the carpal bones. Notably, there is a visible fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the normal cortical outline and slight displacement. Additionally, the alignment of the carpals appears abnormal, potentially indicating a carpal dislocation or significant soft tissue injury.
