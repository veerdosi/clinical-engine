The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Notable findings include a prominent joint effusion in the knee region, indicated by increased soft tissue opacity surrounding the joint space. Additionally, there appears to be a subtle cortical irregularity at the lateral aspect of the distal femur, which may suggest an underlying bone lesion or stress-related change.
