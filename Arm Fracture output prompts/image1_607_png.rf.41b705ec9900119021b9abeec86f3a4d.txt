The X-ray image demonstrates the left hand in a posterior-anterior view, revealing the bony structures of the proximal phalanx and interphalangeal joints. Clear signs of osteophyte formation can be observed, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis affecting the digit. Additionally, there is a notable subluxation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting potential instability or ligamentous injury in the digit.
