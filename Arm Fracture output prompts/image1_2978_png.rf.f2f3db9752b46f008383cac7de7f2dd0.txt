The X-ray image reveals a hyperplastic osseous growth in the distal radius, consistent with the presence of an osteochondroma, a benign bone tumor. There is evidence of cortical thinning in the area surrounding the lesion, indicating potential localized stress or pressure effects on the adjacent bone structures. Additionally, the articular surfaces at the wrist joint appear congruent, with no evident signs of degenerative changes or acute fractures.
