The X-ray image depicts the forearm region, showing both the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a fracture within the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortical bone continuity, accompanied by some degree of soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area. Additionally, there may be signs of malalignment, suggesting the potential for displacement at the fracture site, warranting further evaluation for appropriate management.
