The image presents an X-ray of the left arm, showcasing the humerus, radius, and ulna in a lateral view. There is evidence of a significant angular deformity in the mid-shaft region of the humerus, indicative of a potential fracture or malalignment. Additionally, there appears to be cortical disruption with an associated soft tissue swelling, which may suggest an acute injury or pathologic process affecting the bony integrity.
