The image displays a radiograph of the right forelimb, specifically focusing on the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is a clear alteration in the normal curvature of the ulna, which presents with a noticeable bowing deformity, suggesting potential osteogenic abnormalities. Additionally, the joint space between the ulna and the carpal bones appears to be narrowed, indicating possible degenerative changes or inflammatory joint disease.
