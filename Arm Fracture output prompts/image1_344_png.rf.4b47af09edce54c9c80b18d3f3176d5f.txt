The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right elbow joint, revealing the bony articulations between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable findings include the presence of osteophytes at the olecranon process, suggestive of osteoarthritis, and joint space narrowing indicative of potential degenerative changes. There are no acute fractures or dislocations observed in the visualized bones, although the alignment appears slightly altered with potential subluxation of the radial head.
