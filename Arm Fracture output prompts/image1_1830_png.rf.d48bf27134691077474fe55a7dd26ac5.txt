The radiograph reveals a fracture in the distal radius characterized by angulation and separation of the fracture fragments. There is notable displacement of the fracture, which may suggest instability in the wrist joint. Surrounding soft tissues appear intact without any significant evidence of effusion or hematoma in the visualized area.
