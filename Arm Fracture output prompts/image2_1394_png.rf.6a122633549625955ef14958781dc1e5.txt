The X-ray image displays the elbow joint in a flexed position, highlighting the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna. Signs of an abnormality are evident, particularly in the joint space which may indicate the presence of osteophytes or signs of degenerative joint disease. Additionally, any potential misalignment or bone irregularities within the supracondylar region could suggest possible fractures or post-traumatic changes.
