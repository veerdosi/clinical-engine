The x-ray image shows an abnormality in the left arm, specifically affecting the ulna and radius, which are distinctly visible. There appears to be a significant angulation or malalignment in the distal radius, indicating a possible fracture or deformity. Additionally, the joint spaces in the wrist region may suggest signs of arthritis or post-traumatic changes, corroborating the presence of a degenerative process in the surrounding soft tissues.
