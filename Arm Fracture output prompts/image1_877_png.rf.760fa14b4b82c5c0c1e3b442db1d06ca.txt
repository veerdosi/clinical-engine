The X-ray image demonstrates an acute mid-shaft humeral fracture, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity with displacement. Notably, an internal fixation device, likely a plate and screw system, is observed, indicating surgical stabilization of the fracture site. Additionally, there is a possible association with surrounding soft tissue swelling, which may suggest hematoma formation or inflammation in the acute setting.
