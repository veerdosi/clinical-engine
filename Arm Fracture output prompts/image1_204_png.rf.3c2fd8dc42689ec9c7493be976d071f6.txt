The X-ray image displays the right hand, prominently featuring the phalanges of the little finger (5th digit). Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture in the proximal phalanx, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be present, indicating possible soft tissue injury or inflammation associated with the observed bony disruption.
