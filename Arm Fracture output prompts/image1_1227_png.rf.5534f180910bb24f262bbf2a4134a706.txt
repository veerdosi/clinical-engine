The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a deformity characterized by angulation at the midshaft of the radius, suggesting the presence of a possible fracture or stress-related change. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable with no acute abnormalities noted in the elbow or wrist joints.
