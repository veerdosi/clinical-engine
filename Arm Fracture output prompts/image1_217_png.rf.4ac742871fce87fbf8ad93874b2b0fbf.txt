The X-ray image shows the right forearm, specifically the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius with possible accompanying positivity of the ulnar cortex, suggestive of a simple fracture type. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating a potential soft tissue injury associated with the osseous disruption.
