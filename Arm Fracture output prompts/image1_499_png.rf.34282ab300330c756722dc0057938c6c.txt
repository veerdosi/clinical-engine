The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right hand, highlighting the metacarpals and phalanges. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the proximal phalanx of the second digit, with associated cortical disruption and soft tissue swelling suggested. Additionally, minor osteophyte formation may be observed at the metacarpophalangeal joint, indicating possible early degenerative changes.
