The radiograph displays a right elbow joint with significant radiopacity due to the presence of metallic hardware, indicative of previous surgical intervention, likely involving internal fixation. Observed is an angular deformity of the distal humerus, suggestive of malalignment, which may correlate with a history of fracture. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling evident adjacent to the joint, indicating possible post-traumatic changes or inflammatory response.
