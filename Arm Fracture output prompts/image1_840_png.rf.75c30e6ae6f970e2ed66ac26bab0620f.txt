The X-ray image depicts the left upper extremity with an emphasis on the humerus, forearm, and wrist. There appears to be a significant alignment deformity characterized by angulation, indicative of a malunion or nonunion fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observable, which may suggest underlying inflammation or acute injury.

Further examination reveals areas of cortical discontinuity along the shaft of the radius, suggesting the presence of a possible fracture. There is also evidence of bone density changes, raising concerns for potential osteopenia or pathological involvement. Joint spaces appear intact; however, any associated ligamentous injuries would require further evaluation for comprehensive assessment.
