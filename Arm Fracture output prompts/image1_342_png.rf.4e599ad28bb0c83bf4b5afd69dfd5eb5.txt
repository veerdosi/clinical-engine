The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna, showing a well-defined cortical line indicating normal bone architecture. There are no visible fractures or dislocations noted in the periphery; however, slight cortical irregularities may suggest early signs of osteopenia. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable, with no evidence of joint effusion or periosteal reaction.
