This right forearm X-ray reveals evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by a dorsal angulation at the fracture site. There is also notable soft tissue swelling in the periphery, possibly indicating a concomitant hematoma. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, suggesting no associated carpal injury at this time.
