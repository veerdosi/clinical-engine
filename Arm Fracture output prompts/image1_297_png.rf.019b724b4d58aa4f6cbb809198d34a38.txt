The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna in the forearm, with particular attention to the carpal bones in the wrist region. There is notable displacement and angulation at the distal radial metaphysis, suggestive of a fracture likely classified as a distal radius fracture, commonly associated with falls or trauma. Additionally, there are signs of possible joint effusion in the wrist, potentially indicating associated soft tissue injury or inflammation.
