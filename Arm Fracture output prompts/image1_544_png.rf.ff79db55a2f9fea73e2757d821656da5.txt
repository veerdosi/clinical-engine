The X-ray image displays the right wrist and distal radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone continuity and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no evidence of dislocation or significant degenerative changes observed in the joint spaces.
