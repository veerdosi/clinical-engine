The X-ray image shows the wrist and distal forearm, with evident signs of a distal radius fracture characterized by a fracture line at the metaphysis. The alignment of the distal radius appears disrupted, indicating possible dorsal angulation or displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, there are soft tissue swelling and effusion observable in the surrounding regions, suggesting an associated injury or inflammatory response.
