The X-ray image of the hand shows a significant joint effusion in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger, indicated by an increased radiolucent area. There is also evidence of periarticular osteopenia, suggesting possible inflammatory arthropathy, potentially indicative of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease. Additionally, the phalangeal bones exhibit signs of subchondral cyst formation, which may be associated with degenerative changes or chronic joint stress.
