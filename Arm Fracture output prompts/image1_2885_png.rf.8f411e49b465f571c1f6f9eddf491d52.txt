The X-ray image presents the left wrist in an anteroposterior view, demonstrating normal anatomical alignment of the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of subtle joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint, which may suggest early degenerative changes or osteoarthritis. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the wrist exhibits mild swelling, which could indicate a possible inflammatory response or trauma, but no acute fractures are observed within this view.
