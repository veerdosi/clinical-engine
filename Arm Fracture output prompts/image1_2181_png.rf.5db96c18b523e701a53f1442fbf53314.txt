The X-ray image reveals an obvious fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and associated soft tissue swelling. The alignment of the carpal bones is altered, indicative of potential dislocation or subluxation at the wrist joint. Additionally, there is evidence of possible early osteoarthritis changes manifesting as joint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis in the carpal region.
