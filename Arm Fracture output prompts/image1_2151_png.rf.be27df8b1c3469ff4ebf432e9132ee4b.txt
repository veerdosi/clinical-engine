The X-ray image displays the bones of the right wrist and hand, showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and proximal phalanges distinctly. There is evidence of a possible fracture or displacement noted in the distal radius, potentially indicating a Colles' fracture characterized by dorsal angulation. Additionally, the joint spaces appear to be preserved, but there may be signs of joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, suggesting inflammation or trauma in the surrounding soft tissues.
