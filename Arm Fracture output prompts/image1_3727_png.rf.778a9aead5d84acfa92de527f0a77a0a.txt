The provided X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left knee joint, showing the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of an intra-articular hardware present, suggestive of prior surgical intervention, likely for the fixation of a fracture. Additionally, there is a notable joint alignment and no acute fractures visible in the surrounding osseous structures, although degenerative changes may be evaluated based on further analysis.
