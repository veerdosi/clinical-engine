The X-ray image appears to show the left shoulder joint, with a focus on surrounding anatomical structures such as the humerus and scapula. Notably, there are signs of potential joint effusion or degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, which may indicate underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis. The alignment of the proximal humerus is assessed for any deformities or fractures, particularly at the surgical neck, which could have implications for shoulder mobility and stability.
