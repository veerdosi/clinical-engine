The X-ray image depicts the lateral view of the right hand, highlighting the first metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the thumb. Notable findings include a potential fracture of the distal phalanx, characterized by cortical disruption and possible displacement. Additionally, there is joint effusion observed in the carpometacarpal joint, which may suggest underlying inflammatory or traumatic pathology.
