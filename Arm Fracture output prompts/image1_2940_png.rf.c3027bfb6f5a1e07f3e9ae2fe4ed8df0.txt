The X-ray image depicts the left hand, specifically focusing on the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable is the presence of metallic foreign objects, which may indicate prior surgical intervention or the presence of an implant. Additionally, there is observable deformity in the alignment of certain phalanges, suggesting potential pathology or joint involvement, which would require further clinical correlation for diagnosis.
