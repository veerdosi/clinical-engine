The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the forearm, clearly displaying the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is a mid-shaft diaphyseal fracture of the radius with cortical discontinuity, indicating significant bony compromise. Additionally, some soft tissue swelling is observed adjacent to the fracture site, which may suggest associated contusion or hematoma formation.
