The X-ray image illustrates the left elbow joint with notable radiopaque hardware, indicative of prior surgical intervention, likely for stabilization or fixation. There is evident consolidation of the surrounding soft tissues, suggesting the presence of periarticular changes. Additionally, the joint space exhibits signs of possible degenerative changes, characterized by the destruction of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone changes, indicating an underlying arthropathy.
