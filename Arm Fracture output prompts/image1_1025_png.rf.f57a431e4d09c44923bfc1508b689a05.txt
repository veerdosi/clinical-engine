The X-ray image displays multiple views of the wrist and forearm, highlighting the radiographic anatomy of the distal radius and ulna. Notable findings include a potential fracture of the distal radius in the lateral view, characterized by cortical disruption and periosteal reaction, indicating acute injury. Additionally, there may be signs of subsequent joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, as inferred from the lucency surrounding the involved areas.
