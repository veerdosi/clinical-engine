The X-ray image reveals the carpal and metacarpal bones of the wrist and hand, with a noticeable distortion in the alignment of the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a possible fracture in the radial neck, as indicated by the radiolucent line and potential comminution. Soft tissue swelling may be observed adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting associated trauma or inflammation in the region.
