Notable findings include possible signs of osteoarthritis in the distal interphalangeal joints, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis. Additionally, the presence of a bony deformity in one of the proximal phalanges may indicate a malalignment or previous trauma affecting the overall morphology of the hand.
