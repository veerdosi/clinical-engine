The X-ray image displays the phalanges and metacarpals of the hand, revealing indications of potential osteoarthritis characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis in the distal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there is visible fragmentation and irregularity at the base of some of the proximal phalanges, suggesting possible osteochondral lesions or previous fracture healing complications. There is a bilateral involvement, particularly noticeable in the second and third digits, which may indicate a systemic process affecting the joint structures.
