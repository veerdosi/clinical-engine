The X-ray displays a mid-shaft femoral fracture, characterized by an oblique fracture line with further separation visible between fragments. There is notable cortical disruption and misalignment at the fracture site, suggesting a significant degree of displacement. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, although this is not directly visible on the radiograph.
