The x-ray image displays the phalanges of the hand, specifically highlighting the middle and distal segments of the fingers. There is a noticeable deformity in one of the distal phalanges, characterized by angulation and potential misalignment, suggesting possible post-traumatic changes or an underlying arthritic condition. Additionally, the joint spaces appear narrowed in some areas, which may indicate degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis affecting the distal interphalangeal joints.
