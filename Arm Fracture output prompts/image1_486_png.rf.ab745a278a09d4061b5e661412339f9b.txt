The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna in their anatomical positions. There is notable joint effusion observed at the elbow, characterized by an increase in the suprapatellar fat pad, which may indicate inflammation or injury. Additionally, the alignment of the olecranon and coronoid processes appears intact, with no acute fractures or dislocations evident in the surrounding bony structures.
