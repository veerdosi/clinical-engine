The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left shoulder joint, with an observable abnormality in the proximal humerus. There is evidence of an osteolytic lesion located in the humeral head, which may suggest the presence of a pathological process such as a benign tumor or malignancy. Additionally, there is potential cortical disruption indicating compromised bone integrity, warranting further evaluation for underlying conditions.
