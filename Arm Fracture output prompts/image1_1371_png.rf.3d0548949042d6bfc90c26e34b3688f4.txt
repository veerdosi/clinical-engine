The X-ray image demonstrates a right shoulder joint with an apparent acromioclavicular joint separation, characterized by a displacement between the acromion and the distal end of the clavicle. There is also evidence of potential subacromial impingement, as indicated by bony irregularities around the acromion and possible thickening of the rotator cuff. Additionally, mild degenerative changes are observed in the glenohumeral joint, with reduced joint space and marginal osteophyte formation.
