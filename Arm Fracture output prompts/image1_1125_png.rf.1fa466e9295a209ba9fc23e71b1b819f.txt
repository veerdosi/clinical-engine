The X-ray image shows the left wrist joint, with particular emphasis on the distal radius and distal ulna. Notably, there is a dorsal angulation of the distal radius, indicating a potential fracture, commonly associated with Colles' fracture. There appears to be soft tissue swelling around the joint, which may suggest an inflammatory process or hematoma formation.
