The X-ray reveals a lateral view of the knee joint, showcasing a significant fracture involving the distal femur and the proximal tibia, indicative of a possible intra-articular injury. The presence of internal fixation devices within the joint space suggests a previous surgical intervention aimed at stabilizing the fracture. There is also evidence of potential joint effusion and overlying soft tissue swelling, which may indicate an inflammatory process or post-surgical sequelae.
