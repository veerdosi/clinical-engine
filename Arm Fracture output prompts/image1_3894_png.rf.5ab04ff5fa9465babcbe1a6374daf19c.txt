The provided X-ray image depicts the lateral view of a human hand, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. There is evidence of osteopenia in the metacarpals, suggesting a decrease in bone density which may predispose the patient to fractures. Additionally, a prominent deformity is noted in the distal phalanx of the index finger, indicative of possible previous trauma or established malunion.
