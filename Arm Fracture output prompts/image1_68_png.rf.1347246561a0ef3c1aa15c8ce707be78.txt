The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the left forearm, clearly showing both the radius and ulna. There is notable evidence of a mid-shaft radial fracture characterized by a distinct disruption of the cortex with possible comminution. Additionally, there are signs of distal radius involvement, as well as soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, which may indicate associated contusion or hematoma formation.
