The X-ray presents a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, showing a noticeable widening of the joint spaces at the wrist, indicative of potential degenerative joint disease. There is a marked presence of osteophyte formation at the radial styloid process, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis in the radio-carpal joint. Additionally, the image reveals a cortical bone irregularity on the ulnar aspect, which could indicate possible previous trauma or a developing stress fracture.
