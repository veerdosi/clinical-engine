The X-ray image displays multiple views of the hand, showing the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notable in the images are signs of joint effusion and potential soft tissue swelling around the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, which may indicate inflammation or an underlying arthritic process. Additionally, there are possible osseous irregularities or displacement in the proximal phalanx, suggestive of a fracture or previous fracture-healing response.
