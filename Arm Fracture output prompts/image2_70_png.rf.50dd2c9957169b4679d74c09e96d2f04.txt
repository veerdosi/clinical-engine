The X-ray image displays an evident fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical bone integrity. There are angular deformities observed, suggesting a potential misalignment, which may indicate a complicated fracture pattern. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable with no significant effusion or signs of acute inflammation noted.
