The radiographic image displays three views of the right hand, focusing on the phalanges of the fingers. Of particular note is the presence of a transverse fracture located in the proximal phalanx of the second digit, characterized by a break of the cortical bone. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate the presence of a hematoma or inflammation consistent with acute traumatic injury.
