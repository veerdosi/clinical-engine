The X-ray shows a longitudinal view of the forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by a complete disruption in the cortical bone continuity, with potential displacement observable. The surrounding soft tissues appear intact, without significant signs of edema or hematoma formation noted in this projection.
