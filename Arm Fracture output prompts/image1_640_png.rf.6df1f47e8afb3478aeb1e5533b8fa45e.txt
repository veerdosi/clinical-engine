The X-ray image reveals the left shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding soft tissues. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency, which may suggest the presence of inflammatory conditions such as bursitis or arthritis. Additionally, signs of osteophyte formation are notable along the acromion, indicative of potential degenerative changes consistent with impingement syndrome.
