The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the right hand, revealing a malalignment of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger, indicative of a potential dislocation. There is an osseous abnormality at the level of the phalanx, characterized by a fracture that appears to have disrupted the anatomical continuity of the bone. Surrounding soft tissues exhibit edema, as inferred by the radiolucency around the affected area, which may suggest an inflammatory response associated with the injury.
