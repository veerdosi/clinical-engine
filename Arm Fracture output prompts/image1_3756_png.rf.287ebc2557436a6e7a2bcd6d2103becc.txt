The image depicts an oblique radiograph of the right hand, highlighting the phalangeal structures of the thumb. Upon examination, there is evidence of a dorsal angulation and possible malalignment of the distal phalanx, suggestive of a potential fracture or deformity. The soft tissue surrounding the phalanges appears intact, with no signs of acute edema or significant joint effusion evident in the adjacent carpometacarpal joint.
