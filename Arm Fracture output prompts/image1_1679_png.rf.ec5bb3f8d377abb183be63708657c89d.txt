The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, presenting an intra-articular fracture involving the wrist joint. The presence of metallic fixation devices indicates prior surgical intervention aimed at stabilizing the fracture. Notably, there is a potential malalignment or displacement of the fracture fragments, which may complicate the healing process and joint function.
