There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency surrounding the joint capsule, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory condition. Additionally, there is a noticeable misalignment of the epicondyles, suggesting possible post-traumatic changes or a deformity related to prior injury mechanisms.
