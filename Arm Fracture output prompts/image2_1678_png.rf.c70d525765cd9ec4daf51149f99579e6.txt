The X-ray image depicts a right forearm with a prominent diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone and an accompanying fracture line. There is notable displacement of the proximal fragment, which may indicate instability in the fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue edema can be inferred around the fracture site, suggesting an acute injury response.
