The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showcasing both the radius and ulna in a lateral view. Notable is the presence of a fracture at the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a complete transverse disruption of the cortical bone. There is also mild angulation observed in the distal segment of the ulna, suggesting possible associated soft tissue injury or swelling in the surrounding areas.
