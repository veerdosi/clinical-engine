The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of a hand in an anteroposterior view, illustrating the phalangeal alignment of the fingers. Notably, there appears to be an angulation of the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may suggest the presence of a malunion or previous fracture. Additionally, joint spaces between the metacarpophalangeal joints appear preserved, indicating a lack of significant arthritic changes at this time.
