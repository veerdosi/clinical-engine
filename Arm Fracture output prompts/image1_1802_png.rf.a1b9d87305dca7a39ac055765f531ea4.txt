The X-ray image displays a left hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is a small, well-defined, round radiolucent lesion identified in the distal phalanx, which may indicate an underlying pathology such as a cyst or bone tumor. Additionally, the surrounding bone appears to be unremarkable, with no evidence of cortical disruption or significant osteopenia.
