The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, specifically the radius and ulna. There is an observed fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a disruption in cortical continuity and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction along the fracture site, suggesting a potential healing response to the injury.
