The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the right elbow joint, exhibiting a notable joint effusion. There is also a possible fracture line at the olecranon process of the ulna, suggesting an olecranon fracture, which may be accompanied by associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, signs of potential intra-articular involvement can be inferred from the displacement noted in the surrounding structures.
