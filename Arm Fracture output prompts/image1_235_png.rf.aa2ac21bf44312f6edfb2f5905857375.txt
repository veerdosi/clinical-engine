The X-ray image displayed reveals an oblique view of the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. Notably, there is evidence of malalignment in one of the proximal phalanx bones, suggestive of a potential fracture or dislocation. Additionally, an irregularity in the bone density and contour is observed, which may indicate the presence of an underlying pathology such as arthritis or a previous injury.
