The x-ray image depicts the right knee joint in a lateral view, showcasing the distal femur, proximal tibia, and the patella. There is an abnormal joint space narrowing, suggesting the presence of osteoarthritis or potential joint degeneration. Additionally, any abnormal bone density or the presence of osteophytes around the femoral and tibial surfaces should be noted for further evaluation of degenerative changes in the joint.
