The X-ray image displays the knee joint, specifically highlighting the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella. There is noticeable joint space narrowing, possibly indicative of osteoarthritis, characterized by reduced cartilage thickness leading to increased bone-on-bone contact. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is observed, reflecting changes in the underlying bone due to chronic stress or degeneration.
