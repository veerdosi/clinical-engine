The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing both the radius and ulna in an anteroposterior view. A notable fracture is observed in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity, and potential displacement may be present. The surrounding soft tissue appears intact, but further evaluation may be necessary to assess for any accompanying hematoma or soft tissue injury.
