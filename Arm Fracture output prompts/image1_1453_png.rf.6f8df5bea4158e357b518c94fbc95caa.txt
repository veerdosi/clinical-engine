The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint (LT JT EXTROI) with a view of the proximal humerus and scapula. There is evidence of possible bone pathology, specifically in the acromion and the humeral head, which may indicate degenerative changes or potential osseous abnormalities. Additionally, the glenohumeral joint space appears narrowed, suggesting a possible joint effusion or reactive changes consistent with inflammatory arthropathy.
