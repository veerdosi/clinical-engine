The image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, with clear visualization of both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a mid-shaft fracture of the radius characterized by a significant displacement, indicative of potential instability. The alignment of the ulna appears intact; however, signs of periosteal reaction may suggest underlying inflammation or healing response.
