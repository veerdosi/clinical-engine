The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, clearly showing the humeral head in relation to the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is evidence of a possible degenerative change reflected in the presence of osteophytes along the glenoid rim, suggesting glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Additionally, the acromion appears to have a slightly hooked morphology, indicative of potential subacromial impingement.
