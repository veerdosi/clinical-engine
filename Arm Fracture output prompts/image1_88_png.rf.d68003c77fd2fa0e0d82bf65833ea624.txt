The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal and metacarpal regions of the wrist. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by the disruption of the cortical bone and a potential angulation. Additionally, minor displacement or malalignment may be observed along with associated soft tissue swelling, indicating possible trauma or injury to the wrist region.
