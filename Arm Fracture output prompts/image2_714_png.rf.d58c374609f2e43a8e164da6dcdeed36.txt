The X-ray image depicts a longitudinal view of the forearm, showing the radius and ulna bones. There appears to be a noticeable radiolucent line indicating a possible fracture, with associated cortical disruption visible in the diaphysis of the radius. Additionally, there may be signs of surrounding soft tissue edema, which could suggest an inflammatory response related to the fracture.
