The X-ray image presented shows the right forearm, including the radius and ulna in a standard anteroposterior view. Notably, there is evidence of a possible fracture or deformity in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and alterations in bone contour. Additionally, the distal radioulnar joint appears intact, with no visible signs of dislocation or significant degenerative changes in the surrounding carpal bones.
