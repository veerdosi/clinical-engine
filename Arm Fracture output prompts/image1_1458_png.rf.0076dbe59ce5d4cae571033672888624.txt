The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the shoulder joint and proximal humerus. Notably, there is evidence of grade 2 acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) separation, characterized by a widening of the joint space and potential disruption of the surrounding soft tissue structures. Additionally, the presence of osteophyte formation along the acromion suggests the possibility of degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, consistent with osteoarthritis.
