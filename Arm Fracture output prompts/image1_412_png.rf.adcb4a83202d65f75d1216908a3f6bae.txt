The x-ray image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable findings include possible joint effusion and an abnormal alignment of the lateral and medial epicondyles, suggesting potential hyperextension injury or instability. Additionally, subtle osteophyte formation at the medial aspect of the humerus may indicate early degenerative changes or chronic stress in the elbow joint.
