The image presents an X-ray of the left shoulder displaying a glenoid component of a reverse shoulder prosthesis, characterized by its spherical surface and elongated stem. Notable is the presence of cortical bone surrounding the prosthetic joint, which may indicate a postoperative status after total shoulder arthroplasty, often performed for conditions such as severe glenohumeral arthritis or proximal humeral fractures. The soft tissue structures adjacent to the implant appear to have preserved alignment, without significant signs of acute complications like infection or dislocation evident in this view.
