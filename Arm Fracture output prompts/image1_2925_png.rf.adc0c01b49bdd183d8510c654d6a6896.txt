The X-ray image reveals the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, with a notable delineation of the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There appears to be evidence of degenerative joint changes, potentially indicating glenohumeral osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additional visualization of the acromion shows a possible acromial impingement, which may contribute to shoulder pain and limitation in range of motion.
