The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint and adjacent structures, revealing a potential radiolucency around the capitulum indicative of retrocondylar pathologies. Additionally, there may be signs of periarticular soft tissue swelling, which could suggest an inflammatory process in the surrounding musculature or synovial tissue. The forearm demonstrates alignment issues that may point toward either malalignment of the radial or ulnar head, or possible prior trauma to the joint architecture.
