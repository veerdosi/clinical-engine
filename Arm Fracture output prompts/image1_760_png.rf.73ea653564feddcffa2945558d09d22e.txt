The X-ray image reveals a potential fracture of the proximal humerus, characterized by a displacement at the surgical neck. There is also evidence of joint effusion in the shoulder joint space, indicating possible associated rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the acromioclavicular joint appears to be mildly separated, which may suggest a grade I or II acromioclavicular injury.
