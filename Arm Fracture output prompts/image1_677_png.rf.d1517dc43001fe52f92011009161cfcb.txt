The radiograph demonstrates an articulated view of the right elbow joint, highlighting the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, indicative of potential osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a joint effusion, which may suggest synovitis or inflammatory changes within the elbow joint capsule.
