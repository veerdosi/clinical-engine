The X-ray image displays the distal femur and proximal tibia, specifically evaluating the knee joint. Prominent joint effusion is observed, indicated by increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar recess, suggestive of synovial fluid accumulation. Additionally, there may be signs of marginal osteophyte formation at the articular surfaces, indicating potential osteoarthritis in the joint space.
