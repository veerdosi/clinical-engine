The X-ray depicts a transverse fracture of the diaphysis of the radius, characterized by a complete break in the bone continuity. There is also a notable displacement at the fracture site, indicating potential instability which may affect the surrounding soft tissue. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed around the fracture zone, suggesting an associated hematoma or edema resulting from the injury.
