The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of the right hand, revealing the metacarpals and phalanges. There is notable osteopenia in the proximal phalanges, indicating a reduction in bone density which may predispose the bones to fragility. Additionally, the phalangeal joints appear to exhibit signs of arthritic changes, characterized by osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing.
