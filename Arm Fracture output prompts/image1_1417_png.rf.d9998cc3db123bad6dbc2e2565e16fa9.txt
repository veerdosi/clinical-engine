The X-ray image displays a left wrist with a visible metallic plate placed over the distal radius, indicating a history of surgical intervention, likely for fracture fixation. There is evidence of cortical discontinuity in the radial shaft, suggesting prior trauma or operative intervention. Additionally, no signs of acute fractures or dislocations are observed in the surrounding carpal or metacarpal bones, maintaining overall alignment.
