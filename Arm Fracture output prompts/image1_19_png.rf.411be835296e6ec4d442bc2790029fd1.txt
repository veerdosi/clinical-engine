The X-ray image depicts a right elbow joint in a flexed position, demonstrating alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is notable angulation at the elbow, possibly indicating a cubitus varus or cubitus valgus deformity, which may lead to altered biomechanics of the forearm. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the joint could suggest an underlying inflammatory process or injury.
