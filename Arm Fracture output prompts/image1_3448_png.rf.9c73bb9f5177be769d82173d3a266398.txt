The X-ray image reveals the phalanges of the digits with notable joint spaces, particularly at the proximal interphalangeal joints. There appears to be soft tissue swelling consistent with possible tenosynovitis, as well as minor malalignment of the proximal phalanx, suggestive of a potential deformity. Additionally, the overall bone density appears to be within normal limits; however, a subtle periosteal reaction is present, which may indicate an underlying inflammatory process.
