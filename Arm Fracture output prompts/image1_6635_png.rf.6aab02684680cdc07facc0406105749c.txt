The X-ray image depicts the shoulder joint, specifically showing the humeral head and glenoid cavity. There is an observable subluxation of the glenohumeral joint, indicated by the position of the humeral head relative to the glenoid. Additionally, there is evidence of possible soft tissue swelling around the joint, which may suggest the presence of an inflammatory process or trauma.
