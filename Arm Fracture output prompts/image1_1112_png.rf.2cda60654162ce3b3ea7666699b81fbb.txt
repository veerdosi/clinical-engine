The X-ray image shows the bones of the right wrist and hand, including the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal regions. There is noticeable joint space narrowing and cystic changes located in the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb, indicative of potential osteoarthritis. Additionally, mild cortical thinning may be observed in some areas, suggesting possible bone density issues or early signs of osteopenia.
