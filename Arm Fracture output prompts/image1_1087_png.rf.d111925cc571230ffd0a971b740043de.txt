The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the shoulder joint, highlighting potential abnormalities around the glenohumeral articulation. Notably, there appears to be an irregularity in the proximal humerus, which may suggest a possible fracture or bone lesion affecting the integrity of the bone structure. Additionally, signs of joint effusion or degenerative changes in the surrounding soft tissues may be present, pointing towards potential inflammatory or traumatic conditions affecting the shoulder.
