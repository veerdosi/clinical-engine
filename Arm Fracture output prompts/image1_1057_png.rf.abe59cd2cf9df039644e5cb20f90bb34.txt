The provided radiographic image displays the left wrist in an anteroposterior view, with clear visualisation of the carpal bones, metacarpals, and proximal phalanges. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint, indicative of potential degenerative changes or arthritic conditions. Additionally, there may be signs of osseous irregularities or cystic changes that warrant further assessment to evaluate for possible localized bone pathology or other underlying conditions.
