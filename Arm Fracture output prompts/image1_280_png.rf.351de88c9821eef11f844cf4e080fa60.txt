The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the hand, illustrating the phalangeal architecture. There is a notable presence of osteopenia observed in the metacarpal and phalangeal bones, which may indicate a reduction in bone density. Additionally, slight periosteal thickening is visible, suggesting a potential inflammatory process or chronic mechanical stress affecting the bony structures.
