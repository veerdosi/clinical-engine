The X-ray image depicts the left hand, showing the bony structures of the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable findings include the presence of a possible fracture in the proximal phalanx, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue swelling. There is also evidence of potential joint effusion noted at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which may indicate an inflammatory process or injury.
