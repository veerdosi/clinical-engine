The X-ray image reveals an oblique fracture of the diaphysis of the radius in the left forearm, with no apparent involvement of the adjacent ulnar bone. There is evidence of callus formation at the fracture site, indicating a healing process, and the alignment of the fracture suggests a moderate degree of displacement. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, without signs of significant edema or hematoma.
