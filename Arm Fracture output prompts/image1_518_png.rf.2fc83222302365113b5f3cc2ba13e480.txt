The X-ray image displays a left shoulder joint with a focus on the humeral head and glenoid cavity. There is evidence of a possible articular surface irregularity suggestive of a Hills-Sachs lesion; this is commonly associated with an anterior shoulder dislocation. Additionally, there is a noticeable reduction in the subacromial space, which may indicate potential rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome.
