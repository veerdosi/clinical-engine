The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting both the radius and ulna. Notably, the radial head exhibits displacement, indicative of a possible fracture or dislocation, with associated soft tissue swelling evident in the surrounding areas. Additionally, there appears to be malalignment of the distal radioulnar joint, suggesting potential instability or trauma in this region.
