The X-ray image displays a right forearm, specifically the radius and ulna bones, demonstrating signs of a fracture. The fracture appears to be located in the mid-shaft region of the radius, characterized by a displacement of the bone fragments. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which can indicate inflammation or hematoma formation.
