The X-ray image presents a clear view of the right knee joint, prominently demonstrating the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and the patella. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by increased radiolucency around the joint capsule, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, the distal femur appears to exhibit some irregularity, potentially indicating osteophyte formation, consistent with degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis.
