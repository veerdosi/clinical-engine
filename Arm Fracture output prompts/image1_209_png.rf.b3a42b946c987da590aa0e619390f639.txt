The image depicts a lateral radiograph of the right hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and associated joints. There is a noticeable displacement in the alignment of the proximal interphalangeal joint, suggesting a potential dislocation or subluxation. Additionally, the bone density appears within normal limits, but there are signs of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the affected joint, which may indicate underlying inflammation or trauma.
