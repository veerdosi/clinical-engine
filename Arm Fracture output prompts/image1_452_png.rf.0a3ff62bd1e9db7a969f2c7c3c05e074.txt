The X-ray image displays anteroposterior and lateral views of the left forearm, illustrating the radius and ulna. Notably, there appears to be a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone with potential displacement. Furthermore, soft tissue swelling is evident surrounding the fracture site, indicating an associated contusion that may suggest acute trauma.
