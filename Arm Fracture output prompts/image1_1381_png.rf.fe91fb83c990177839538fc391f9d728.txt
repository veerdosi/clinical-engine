The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the shoulder region, revealing the bony structures including the scapula, clavicle, and proximal humerus. Notably, there is a high-riding humeral head, which may indicate a potential rotator cuff pathology, such as a tear or degeneration. Additionally, there is no evident fracture, but any signs of bone spurs or degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint may suggest arthritis in this area.
