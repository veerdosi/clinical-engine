The X-ray image demonstrates the bony architecture of the left hand, illustrating the anatomical structures of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a potential malalignment of the distal phalanges, suggestive of a possible digital deformity, which may warrant further clinical correlation. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joints, indicating possible osteoarthritic changes or inflammatory arthropathy.
