The x-ray image displays the distal phalanges of the digits, revealing alignment and integrity of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Notably, there is a high degree of radiolucency observed in the area consistent with a potential bone fracture or osteopenia in the surrounding cortical bone structure. Additionally, signs of possible joint effusion may be evident, suggesting an inflammatory or degenerative process affecting the adjacent soft tissues and joint capsule.
