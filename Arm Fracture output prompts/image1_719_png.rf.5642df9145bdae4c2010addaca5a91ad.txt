The X-ray image displays the left knee joint, highlighting both the femur and the tibia with a clear view of the patella. There appears to be a potential misalignment of the joint surfaces, which may suggest the presence of malalignment or an accompanying deformity. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue structures are not distinctly outlined, warranting further investigation for any signs of effusion or pathology.
