The image depicts a left shoulder X-ray, focusing on the proximal humerus and surrounding structures. There is notable osteolytic change evident in the humeral head, consistent with underlying pathology such as osteonecrosis or metastatic disease. Additionally, the glenohumeral joint space appears narrowed, potentially indicating degenerative changes or joint effusion.
