The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulna, alongside the carpal bones, phalanges, and metacarpals of the left hand. Notably, there appears to be significant bone fragmentation and angulation, which raises concern for a potential distal radius fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed around the wrist joint, suggesting the presence of an ongoing inflammatory process or hematoma.
