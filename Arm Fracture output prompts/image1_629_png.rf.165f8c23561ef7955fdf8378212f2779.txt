The X-ray image displays the left knee joint, exhibiting both the femur and tibia in the coronal plane. The joint space appears uniformly narrowed, which may suggest the presence of degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis. Additionally, there are no visible fractures or acute traumatic injuries noted in the surrounding osseous structures, maintaining the integrity of the cortical bone.
