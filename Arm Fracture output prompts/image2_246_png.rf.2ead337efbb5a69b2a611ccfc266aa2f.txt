The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the elbow, revealing the presence of a fixation device, which indicates prior surgical intervention, likely for a fracture. The alignment of the humerus and the ulna appears altered, suggesting a possible malunion or nonunion of a previously fractured bone. Additionally, there is evidence of osseous remodeling around the hardware, which may imply a response to stress or movement at the site of fixation.
