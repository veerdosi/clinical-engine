The X-ray image depicts a significantly angulated fracture of the ulna, located in the mid-shaft area. Notably, there is an associated soft tissue swelling, which may indicate the presence of hematoma or edema surrounding the fracture site. Additionally, the radiographic appearance shows cortical disruption and potential involvement of the periosteum, consistent with a traumatic injury.
