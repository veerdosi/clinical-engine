The X-ray image presents a right shoulder joint with a visible bony fragment indicative of a fracture of the proximal humerus. There is a notable displacement of the fractured segment, suggesting a possible humeral head involvement consistent with a surgical neck fracture. Additionally, surrounding soft tissues may exhibit edema or hemorrhage, reflecting trauma to the area.
