The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an indication of a fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by disruption of the trabecular pattern. Additionally, there appears to be mild cortical irregularity around the fracture site, which may suggest associated soft tissue edema.
