The X-ray depicts the lateral view of a left hand, revealing multiple phalangeal bones of the fingers. Notably, there is a significant dislocation at the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger, characterized by the misalignment of the distal phalanx relative to the middle phalanx. Additionally, there are signs of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint, which may indicate an acute injury or localized inflammatory process.
