The X-ray image displays a clear view of the right wrist and hand, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notably, there are signs of a possible intra-articular fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by misalignment and irregularity in the cortical outline. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed, which may indicate an associated contusion or hematoma in the periarticular region.
