The X-ray image presents a clear view of the wrist joint and distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is a significant displacement of the scaphoid bone, indicative of a potential scaphoid fracture, which is commonly associated with wrist injuries. Additionally, signs of joint effusion may be observed, suggesting inflammatory changes in the surrounding soft tissues or synovial lining.
