The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the right hand, demonstrating the phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is evidence of a malalignment in the distal phalanges, suggesting a potential grade of deformity or injury in this region. Additionally, the joint spaces appear narrowed, which could indicate early signs of osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes in the hand.
