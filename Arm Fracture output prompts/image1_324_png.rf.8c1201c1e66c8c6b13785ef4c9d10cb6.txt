The X-ray image shows a right wrist joint, revealing the carpal bones with distinct alignment. Notably, there is evidence of a possible scaphoid fracture, characterized by a lucent line in the proximal pole of the scaphoid, which is critical for proper wrist function. The surrounding bony architecture appears intact, with no signs of significant degenerative change or joint effusion present in the visualized areas.
