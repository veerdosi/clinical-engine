The X-ray image depicts the bony structures of a human hand, with notable visualization of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a potential malalignment or fracture in one of the proximal phalanges, which may indicate a possible traumatic lesion. Additionally, joint spaces appear preserved, suggesting no immediate signs of degenerative joint disease in the visible articulations.
