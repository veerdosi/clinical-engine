The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a break that is angled rather than transverse. There is accompanying soft tissue swelling indicated, which is often associated with acute fractures, suggesting possible trauma in the area. Additionally, signs of potential periosteal reaction may be observed, indicating an inflammatory response to the fracture.
