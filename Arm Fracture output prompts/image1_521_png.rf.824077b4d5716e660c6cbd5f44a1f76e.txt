The X-ray image of the elbow joint reveals a pronounced joint effusion in the area of the distal humerus and proximal radius. There is notable soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joint space, indicating potential inflammation or a traumatic process. Additionally, the articular surfaces appear well-defined without any evident fracture lines or malalignment, suggesting the integrity of the bony structures while highlighting the presence of a possible underlying pathology.
