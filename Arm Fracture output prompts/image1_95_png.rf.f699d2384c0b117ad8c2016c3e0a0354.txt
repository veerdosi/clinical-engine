The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the right hand, showcasing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges. Notable is the presence of an increase in trabecular density in the proximal phalanx of the index finger, which could indicate a localized osteoblastic activity. Additionally, there appears to be mild joint space narrowing at the metacarpophalangeal joint, suggesting potential degenerative changes consistent with early osteoarthritis.
