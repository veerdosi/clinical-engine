The X-ray image reveals a surgical fixation device, likely a plate with accompanying screws, adjacent to a distal humeral fracture. There is a visible disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone, indicative of a prior fracture in the humerus, which has been stabilized surgically. Periosteal reaction may be noted surrounding the fracture site, suggesting healing or previous injury, with no evident signs of malunion or nonunion visible in the surrounding bone structure.
