The X-ray image displays the proximal humerus, highlighting potential abnormalities in the shoulder joint. Notably, there is a significant disruption in the cortical bone integrity of the humeral head, which may indicate a possible fracture or avulsion injury. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, suggesting the presence of degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology.
