The image displays an X-ray of the left lower extremity, specifically focusing on the tibia and fibula. Notable is the presence of an angulation deformity of the long bones, which may indicate a possible case of varus or valgus misalignment. Additionally, there is evidence of cortical bone thinning that could suggest underlying osteopenia or another metabolic bone disorder.
