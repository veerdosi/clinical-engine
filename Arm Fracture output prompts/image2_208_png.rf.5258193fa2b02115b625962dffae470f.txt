The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of a left humerus with evidence of an orthopedic implant, specifically a plate and screws located along the diaphysis. There is a visible fracture line adjacent to the area of surgical intervention, indicating a previous fracture that has been treated with internal fixation. The surrounding soft tissues may show signs of edema or reactivity, which could suggest a postoperative response, although this is not directly assessable from the image.
