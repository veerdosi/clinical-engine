The X-ray image displays the left hand, with notable attention to the phalanges and metacarpals. There is evidence of a deformity characterized by a possible malalignment or displacement of the proximal and distal phalanges, suggesting the presence of a subluxation or fracture. Furthermore, the joint spaces exhibit variations in width, which may indicate the presence of degenerative changes or early signs of inflammatory arthropathy.
