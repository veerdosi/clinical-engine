The X-ray image reveals a complete fracture of the distal radius and ulna, characterized by a clear break in both bone shafts. There is significant displacement noted at the fracture site, suggesting instability and potential compromise of surrounding soft tissues. Additionally, signs of edema may be observed in the periosteal region, indicative of underlying trauma and inflammatory response.
