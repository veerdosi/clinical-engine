The X-ray image shows an anteroposterior view of the right elbow joint, with a notable emphasis on the ulna and radius, as well as the humerus. There appears to be a possible visible fracture line in the region of the lateral condyle of the humerus, indicative of a potential supracondylar humeral fracture. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion evident in the radiolucent area around the elbow, suggesting possible soft tissue injury or inflammation within the joint capsule.
