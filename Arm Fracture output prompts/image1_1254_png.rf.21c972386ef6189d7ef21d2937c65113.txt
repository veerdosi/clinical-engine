The image displays an anteroposterior (AP) view of the left arm, focusing primarily on the alignment and integrity of the humerus. Notably, there is a visible cortical disruption along the diaphysis of the humerus, suggestive of a potential fracture, with possible angulation or displacement. Surrounding soft tissue appears intact, although any associated effusion or hematoma cannot be definitively assessed in this projection.
