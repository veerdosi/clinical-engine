The X-ray image displays the right forearm, showing both the radius and ulna bones. There is evidence of a potential fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and possible displacement. Additionally, there is angulation noted at the fracture site, which may indicate a compromise of the structural integrity of the bone.
