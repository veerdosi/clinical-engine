The X-ray image displays a clear view of the left forearm, including the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is a visible proximal ulnar fracture characterized by a transverse disruption, which extends through the bone's cortex. Additionally, there appears to be soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, suggestive of associated contusion or hematoma.
