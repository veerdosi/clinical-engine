The X-ray image shows a right forearm in an anteroposterior view, clearly depicting the radius and ulna bones. Evidence of a transverse fracture is observed, particularly in the distal third of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there may be signs of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, indicating an associated soft tissue injury.
