The X-ray image of the right wrist reveals a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a discernible disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. There is associated soft tissue edema noted around the fracture site, suggesting localized inflammation. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears generally preserved, indicating no significant dislocation despite the presence of the fracture.
