The X-ray image displays the right wrist and forearm, encompassing the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones of the wrist. Notably, there is evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by a dorsal angulation and possible impaction of the fracture site. Additionally, there may be signs of associated soft tissue swelling, indicating a potential wrist sprain or ligamentous injury adjacent to the fractured area.
