The X-ray image demonstrates an anterior-posterior view of the right knee joint, revealing significant joint effusion characterized by an enlarged suprapatellar bursa. There appears to be evidence of subchondral bone loss, suggestive of osteoarthritis, with joint space narrowing and marginal osteophytes present on the femoral condyles and tibial plateau. Furthermore, there are irregularities noted in the patellar region, which may indicate chondromalacia patellae contributing to the overall joint instability.
