The X-ray image depicts the distal radius and ulna in the wrist region, showing the scaphoid and lunate bones clearly delineated. There is evidence of a non-displaced fracture at the distal end of the radius, indicated by a visible line through the cortical bone. Additionally, the joint spaces appear normal, with no signs of acute effusion or synovitis observed in the surrounding soft tissues.
