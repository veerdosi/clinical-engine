The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, illustrating the alignment of the distal humerus, proximal ulna, and radius. Notable within the image is the presence of an angular deformity at the elbow, which may suggest a valgus or varus malalignment. Additionally, there is an observable joint effusion, indicated by the radiolucent area surrounding the joint capsule, which could be consistent with conditions such as synovitis or trauma-related hemorrhage.
