The X-ray image displayed is of the left forearm, showing both the radius and ulna. There is evident cortical disruption along the mid-shaft of the radius, indicative of a possible fracture, with associated periosteal reaction noted. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears altered, suggesting misalignment potentially related to dislocation or complex fracture patterns.
