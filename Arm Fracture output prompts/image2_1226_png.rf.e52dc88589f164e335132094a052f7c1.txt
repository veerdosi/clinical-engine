The X-ray image exhibits a surgical implantation of an orthopedic plate fixed to the humerus, indicating previous fracture repair. There is visible callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting ongoing bone healing process. Additionally, the alignment of the humeral head appears normal, with no signs of avascular necrosis or malunion evident in the surrounding cortical bone.
