The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the left elbow joint, showing the presence of a metallic fixation device indicating prior surgical intervention. There is an evident fracture line through the distal humerus, suggesting a possible humeral fracture that has been stabilized with internal fixation. Additionally, there are signs of callus formation surrounding the fracture site, which may denote the healing process of the bone.
