The X-ray image displays a right hand with visible skeletal structures including the metacarpals, phalanges, and distal radii. There is evidence of a metallic fixation device, indicative of surgical intervention, located within the proximal phalanx of the fourth digit, suggesting a previous fracture repair. Notable alignment of the bone segments appears intact; however, evaluation for any signs of surrounding soft tissue edema or joint involvement may be warranted in this case.
