The X-ray image demonstrates a notable radiolucency in the distal humerus, suggestive of a possible pathological fracture or osteolytic lesion. There is also evidence of cortical irregularity, indicating potential underlying bone pathology or a defect. The orientation of the image may obscure additional anatomical details, but the joint space appears potentially compromised, warranting further investigation for associated soft tissue involvement or degenerative changes.
