The X-ray image shows an oblique view of the distal radius, prominently displaying the presence of metallic fixation devices indicating a prior surgical intervention. There is evidence of a periarticular fracture of the distal radius characterized by irregular alignment and loss of normal cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there appears to be some signs of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process post-operatively.
