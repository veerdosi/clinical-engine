The X-ray image displays the left wrist joint, illustrating the anatomical arrangement of the carpal bones, metacarpals, and the distal radioulnar joint. There is evidence of potential osseous pathology, including a possible fracture involving the distal radius, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, joint space narrowing may indicate early degenerative changes or inflammatory arthropathy affecting the radiocarpal articulation.
