The X-ray image illustrates a lateral view of the left upper limb, with a focus on the shoulder, elbow, and distal forearm. Notably, there is a significant angular deformity observed at the elbow joint, suggestive of a possible malalignment or fracture. Additionally, there are signs of possible joint effusion around the elbow, which may indicate an underlying inflammatory process or trauma affecting the area.
