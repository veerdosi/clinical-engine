The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left forearm, prominently illustrating the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an angulated fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement and potential involvement of the carpal bones at the wrist joint. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, indicating a possible acute inflammatory response.
