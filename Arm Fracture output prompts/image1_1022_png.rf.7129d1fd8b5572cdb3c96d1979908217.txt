The X-ray image shows a lateral view of the forearm, revealing a significant fracture of both the radius and ulna. The fracture sites demonstrate complete disruption of the cortical bone with possible comminution at the radius, indicating a high-energy impact. Soft tissue swelling is noted adjacent to the fracture sites, suggesting hematoma formation or inflammatory response.
