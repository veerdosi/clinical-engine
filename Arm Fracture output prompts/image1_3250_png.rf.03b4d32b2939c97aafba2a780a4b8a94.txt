The x-ray image presents a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, revealing an alignment anomaly consistent with a fracture in the distal radius. Evidence of surgical intervention is observed through the presence of metallic fixation devices, indicating possible internal fixation to stabilize the fractured bone. Soft tissue surrounding the fracture site appears unremarkable; however, the presence of edema may suggest post-surgical inflammation or healing responses in the area.
