The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, specifically showcasing the distal radius and ulna. There is a notable displacement and angulation of the distal radius, indicating a potential fracture, commonly referred to as a Colles' fracture when occurring in the distal radius. Additionally, there is cortical disruption and an irregularity at the fracture site, suggestive of acute traumatic injury to the bony structures.
