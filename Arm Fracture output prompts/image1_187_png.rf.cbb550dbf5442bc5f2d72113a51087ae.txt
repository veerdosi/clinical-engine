The X-ray image depicts the right forearm, specifically the distal radius and ulna in a lateral view. Notable is the presence of an angulated fracture of the distal radius, characterized by displacement and cortical disruption at the fracture site, which is indicative of potential instability. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint, suggesting a possible contusion or hematoma, which often accompanies traumatic injuries in this region.
