The X-ray image presents the right shoulder in an anteroposterior (AP) view, showcasing the proximal humerus and scapula. There is an observable proximal humeral fracture, characterized by disruption of the cortical bone and potential displacement, which indicates a significant trauma to the shoulder girdle. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the shoulder joint, suggesting an associated hematoma or inflammatory response.

The acromion appears intact, but there may be signs of rotator cuff involvement, which could complicate the recovery process. Clear visualization of the thoracic cavity reveals the ribs and lung fields, with no acute pulmonary pathology identified in this view. The overall alignment of the shoulder joint and surrounding structures warrants further evaluation to assess for possible complications such as avascular necrosis or post-traumatic arthritis.
