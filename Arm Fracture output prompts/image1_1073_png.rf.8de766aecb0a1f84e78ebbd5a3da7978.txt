The X-ray image depicts an extended finger, illustrating the bony structures of the distal phalanx, proximal phalanx, and the metacarpal bone. Notable findings include a potential fracture or deformity in the distal phalanx, characterized by irregular contouring and displacement. Disruption of the normal anatomical alignment suggests a possible joint effusion or soft tissue injury in the surrounding areas.
