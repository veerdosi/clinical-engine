The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left elbow joint, illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. There is notable radiolucency around the capitellum, suggestive of osteochondritis dissecans, which may indicate a degenerative process affecting the articular cartilage. Additionally, some degree of joint effusion is observed, potentially indicating underlying inflammation or injury to the surrounding soft tissues.
