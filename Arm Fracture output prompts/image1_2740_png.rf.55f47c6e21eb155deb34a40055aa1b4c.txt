The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, providing clear visual assessment of the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a surgical fixation device, indicating a previous intervention for a fracture in the distal radius region, characterized by the presence of metallic hardware. The surrounding soft tissues exhibit normal radiolucency, with no signs of bone malalignment or abnormal periosteal reaction evident in the visualized area.
