The x-ray image displays the proximal humerus and scapula region, providing a clear view of the glenohumeral joint. There is evidence of a possible humeral head deformity, with irregular contours suggesting potential osteoarthritis or trauma-related changes. Additionally, the acromion appears slightly elevated, which may indicate an acromioclavicular joint pathology or impingement syndrome.
