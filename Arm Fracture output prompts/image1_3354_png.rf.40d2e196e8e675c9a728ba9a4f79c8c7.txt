The X-ray image displays an elbow joint in a flexed position, revealing a potentially displaced fracture in the distal humerus. The visual evidence shows irregularity in the articular surface, suggestive of a fracture line that may compromise joint integrity. Additionally, there is the presence of metallic hardware, indicating previous surgical intervention related to the fracture management.

Notably, there is a possibility of underlying hematoma or soft tissue edema surrounding the joint, which could be inferred based on the radiographic appearance. The alignment of the radius and ulna appears unaffected, yet the involvement of the humerus raises concerns regarding potential complications if left untreated. Lastly, careful assessment of joint congruency is essential to evaluate any implications for future mobility and function.
