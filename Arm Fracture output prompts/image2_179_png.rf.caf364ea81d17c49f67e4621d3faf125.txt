The X-ray depicts a mid-shaft fracture of the femur, observable by the displacement of bone fragments. A metallic intramedullary nail is identified within the medullary cavity, indicating a surgical intervention aimed at stabilization and alignment of the fractured bone. Surrounding soft tissue appears to show signs of reactive changes, consistent with the healing process post-surgery.
