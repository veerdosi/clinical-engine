The X-ray image displays a left humerus with an apparent cortical disruption observed mid-shaft, suggestive of a fracture. Surrounding soft tissue edema is noted, indicative of potential hematoma formation associated with the bony injury. Additionally, the alignment of the humerus appears compromised, suggesting possible displacement, which may necessitate further evaluation for surgical intervention.
