The X-ray image presents the right shoulder joint, demonstrating a possible humeral head subluxation, where the head of the humerus appears to be displaced superiorly in relation to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, there is mild cortical irregularity noted on the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may suggest an existing rotator cuff pathology or degenerative changes. The surrounding soft tissue structures and scapula appear unremarkable, with clear visibility of the ribs providing an anatomical reference.
