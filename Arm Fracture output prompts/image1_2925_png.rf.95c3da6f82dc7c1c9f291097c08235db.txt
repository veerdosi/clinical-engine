The image displays an X-ray of the shoulder joint, highlighting the acromion, clavicle, and humeral head. There is evidence of an acromioclavicular joint separation, characterized by displacement between the acromion and clavicle, suggesting a possible ligamentous injury. Additionally, the subacromial space appears narrowed, which may indicate the presence of overlying bursitis or impingement syndrome.
