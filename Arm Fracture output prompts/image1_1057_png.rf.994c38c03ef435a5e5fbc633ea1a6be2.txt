The X-ray image illustrates the distal radius and the carpal bones of the left wrist. Notably, there is evidence of osteopenia, characterized by reduced bone density in the cortices, which may suggest underlying metabolic bone disease. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears normal, although any signs of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling are not visible in this view.
