The X-ray displays an oblique view of the left wrist, highlighting the carpal bones, metacarpals, and proximal phalanges. There is evidence of a dorsal angulation and possible malunion of the distal radius, indicative of a possible previous fracture. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint, which may suggest the presence of degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
