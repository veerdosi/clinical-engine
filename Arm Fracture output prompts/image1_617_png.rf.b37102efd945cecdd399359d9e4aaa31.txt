The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the elbow joint, showing a potential effusion in the joint space. There is likely a prominent radiolucency near the bony articulations, suggestive of an underlying degenerative process or possible fracture. The alignment of the humeral and ulnar structures appears altered, indicating a possible displacement or malalignment associated with pathologies such as olecranon bursitis or inflammatory joint disease.
