The image presents a left lateral X-ray view of the shoulder complex, revealing the scapula, proximal humerus, and a portion of the thoracic cage. Notably, there is evidence of a possible acromioclavicular joint separation characterized by widening of the joint space, which may indicate an acute or chronic traumatic injury. Additionally, the presence of sclerosis or cystic changes within the proximal humerus could suggest underlying lesions or osteoarthritis affecting the glenohumeral joint.
