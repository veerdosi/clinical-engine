The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, highlighting the humerus, scapula, and proximal clavicle. There is evidence of a potential proximal humeral fracture, indicated by an irregular contour at the surgical neck with associated displacement. Additionally, there are signs of possible glenohumeral joint effusion, as suggested by the altered radiolucency around the joint space.
