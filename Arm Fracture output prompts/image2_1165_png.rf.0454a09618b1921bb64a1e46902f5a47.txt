The X-ray image demonstrates the left shoulder joint, with notable visualization of the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There appears to be a possible hypertrophy of the acromion process, which could indicate an acromioclavicular joint condition. The overall alignment of the shoulder complex is maintained; however, further assessment of soft tissue structures may be required to rule out any associated rotator cuff pathology.
