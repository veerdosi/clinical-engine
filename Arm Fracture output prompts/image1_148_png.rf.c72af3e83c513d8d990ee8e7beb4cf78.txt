The X-ray image displays the right hand in a position that suggests the patient is flexing their fingers, with an apparent emphasis on the carpal and metacarpal regions. Notably, the distal radius and ulna appear normal in alignment, but a closer examination reveals possible signs of osteopenia in the bone density. There are no visible fractures or dislocations; however, the joint spaces demonstrate minor soft tissue swelling, which may indicate underlying inflammation or tenosynovitis.
