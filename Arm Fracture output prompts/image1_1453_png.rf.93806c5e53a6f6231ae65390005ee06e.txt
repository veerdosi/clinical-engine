The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, revealing the proximal humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Notable is the presence of an osteophyte formation at the acromion, indicating a potential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome or osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a decrease in the joint space, which may suggest underlying degenerative joint disease affecting the glenohumeral joint.
