The X-ray images of the left wrist reveal a prominent scaphoid bone with associated sclerosis, suggesting a possible fracture or non-union. There is also noted narrowing of the joint space at the wrist, which may indicate degenerative changes or osteoarthritis. Additionally, the presence of osteophytes along the distal ends of the radius and ulna suggests extra-articular bone formation, consistent with chronic inflammatory conditions or long-standing degenerative disease.
