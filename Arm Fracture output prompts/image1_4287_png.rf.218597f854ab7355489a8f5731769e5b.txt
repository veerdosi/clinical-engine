The X-ray reveals an abnormality in the glenohumeral joint region, characterized by joint space narrowing and potential bone erosion. There is evidence of subacromial bone spurring, which may indicate the presence of rotator cuff pathology or impingement syndrome. Additionally, the proximal humerus displays irregular contour, suggesting possible osteophyte formation or degenerative changes associated with osteoarthritis.
