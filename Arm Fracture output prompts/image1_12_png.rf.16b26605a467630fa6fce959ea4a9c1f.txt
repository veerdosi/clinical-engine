The X-ray depicts the right shoulder girdle, illustrating the humeral head adjacent to the glenoid fossa of the scapula. There is evident radiolucency around the shoulder joint, possibly indicating subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff pathology, which could impact shoulder mobility and function. Additionally, the acromion and clavicle appear intact; however, a careful evaluation is warranted to rule out any osseous abnormalities or soft tissue injuries contributing to the observed symptoms.
