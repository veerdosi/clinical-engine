The X-ray image of the left elbow demonstrates a distinct joint effusion, indicated by the ill-defined area of radiolucency around the olecranon. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint space, suggesting possible inflammatory processes. Furthermore, the alignment of the joint appears intact, without any visible fractures of the distal humerus or proximal ulna.
