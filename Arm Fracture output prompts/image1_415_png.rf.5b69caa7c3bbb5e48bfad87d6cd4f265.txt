The X-ray image displays a left forearm, showing evidence of an acute diaphyseal fracture of the radius, characterized by a prominent fracture line. There is also notable angulation of the distal fragment, indicating a possible displacement. Surrounding the fracture site, there may be soft tissue swelling, which can suggest accompanying periosteal reaction or hematoma formation.
