The X-ray depicts an oblique view of the left humerus and forearm, highlighting notable radiopacity indicative of a fracture at the mid-shaft of the humerus. Associated with the fracture, there appears to be a pronounced periosteal reaction suggesting acute injury and possible callus formation. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling around the elbow joint, which could be indicative of hematoma or soft tissue contusion adjacent to the fractured area.
