The X-ray image reveals an apparent distal radius fracture characterized by a dorsal angulation and possible displacement. Internal fixation is evident with metallic hardware, likely indicating a surgical intervention to stabilize the fracture. The surrounding soft tissues appear intact, with no overt signs of edema or hematoma, suggesting post-operative assessment of the fracture repair.
