The x-ray image demonstrates a complex fracture of the humerus, showing a clear disruption in the continuity of the bone. There is notable displacement at the fracture site, indicating the need for potential surgical intervention for proper alignment and stabilization. Additionally, joint effusion in the elbow region may suggest an associated soft tissue injury or intra-articular involvement.
