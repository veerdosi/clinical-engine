The X-ray image displays a right elbow in an extended position, providing a clear view of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is significant joint effusion noted in the elbow joint space, which may indicate underlying inflammatory processes or trauma. Additionally, there appears to be cortical disruption observed along the lateral aspect of the distal humerus, suggestive of possible osteochondral injuries or fracture surfaces.
