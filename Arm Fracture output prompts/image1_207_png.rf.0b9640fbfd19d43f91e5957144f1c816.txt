The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, visualizing the distal humerus and the proximal radius and ulnar bones. Notably, there is evidence of a potential degenerative process at the ulnar and radial articulations, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Additionally, there are signs of previous injuries or stress fractures along the midshaft of the radius, presenting as cortical irregularities that warrant further clinical correlation.
