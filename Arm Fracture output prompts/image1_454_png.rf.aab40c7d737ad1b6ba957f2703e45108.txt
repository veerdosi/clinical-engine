The X-ray demonstrates the phalanges of the right index finger, with particular attention to the interphalangeal joints. Notable is the presence of a possible fracture or deformity at the proximal or distal phalanx, which may indicate trauma or biomechanical stress. The joint spaces appear narrowed, suggesting possible degenerative changes or inflammatory processes affecting the soft tissue structures around the bone.
