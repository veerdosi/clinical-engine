The X-ray image depicts a right forearm with notable signs of an acute fracture, specifically in the distal radius and possibly the ulnar bone as well. There is evidence of callus formation, suggesting a healing process, which is indicative of a previous fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears distorted, indicating possible malunion or improper healing, warranting further assessment for functional implications.
