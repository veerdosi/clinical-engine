The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder region, revealing the scapula, humeral head, and proximal clavicle. Notable observation includes a potential presence of a subacromial spacer or mineralized tissue indicative of calcific tendonitis, particularly in the supraspinatus tendon area. Additionally, there may be evidence suggestive of glenohumeral joint displacement or degenerative changes characterized by joint space narrowing and bony spurs.
