The X-ray image illustrates the left forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna in anteroposterior projection. There is a notable fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the bone continuity and potential dorsal angulation. Soft tissue swelling in the periarticular region is also observed, which may indicate associated trauma or hematoma formation around the fracture site.
