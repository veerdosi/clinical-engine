The image displays an anteroposterior (AP) view of the right knee joint, highlighting the femur, tibia, and fibula in close proximity to the patella. Notably, there appears to be joint space narrowing, which may indicate degenerative changes commonly associated with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there are prominent osteophytes present at the joint margins, suggesting the presence of osteophytic development typically seen in chronic arthritic conditions.
