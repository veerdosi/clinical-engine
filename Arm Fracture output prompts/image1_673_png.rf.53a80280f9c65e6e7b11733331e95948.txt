The X-ray image of the left hand illustrates multiple bones of the carpal and metacarpal regions, demonstrating well-defined joint spaces indicative of normal anatomical alignment. Notably, there is an observed osteophyte formation at the distal interphalangeal joint of the second digit, suggesting a potential osteoarthritic process. The radiographic density appears consistent throughout, with no evidence of acute fractures or significant soft tissue swelling present.
