The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a break in the bone continuity with associated angulation. There is also evidence of possible soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate an inflammatory response. The alignment of the ulna appears preserved, without signs of concurrent fractures or dislocations in this projection.
