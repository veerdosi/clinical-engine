The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the wrist, revealing a prominent dorsal angulation of the distal radius, which is indicative of a potential Colles' fracture. There is evidence of an abnormal alignment between the distal radial and ulnar joint surfaces, demonstrating a possible misalignment associated with this type of fracture. Soft tissue swelling is also noted surrounding the wrist joint, which may suggest acute inflammatory changes related to the underlying bony injury.
