The image presents a right-hand x-ray, primarily focusing on the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the thumb. Notable is the presence of some joint space narrowing, which may indicate early signs of osteoarthritis affecting the CMC joint. Additionally, there is a potential abnormality involving the proximal phalanx, suggesting the possibility of a subluxation or a deformity in the metacarpal arrangement.
