The X-ray image displays the right lower leg, with a particular focus on both the tibia and fibula. Notably, there is evidence of a significant diaphyseal fracture in the tibia, characterized by a displacement and angulation indicating a malalignment of the bone structure. Additionally, the fibula appears intact but is in proximity to the fractured segments of the tibia, suggesting potential soft tissue injury or hematoma formation in the surrounding area.
