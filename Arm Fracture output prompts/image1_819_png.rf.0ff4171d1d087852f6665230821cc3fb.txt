The X-ray image depicts a left elbow joint demonstrating a displaced fracture of the ulna and radius, with evident malalignment at the fracture site. Internal fixation hardware, including a plate and screws, is observed, indicating a surgical intervention aimed at stabilizing the fracture for proper healing. There are signs of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest inflammation associated with the bony injury.
