The X-ray image demonstrates the right shoulder joint, including the proximal humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notable findings include possible signs of rotator cuff pathology, evident by irregularity in the humeral head and potential subacromial impingement due to altered bone morphology. Additionally, there may be indications of degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint, suggesting osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
