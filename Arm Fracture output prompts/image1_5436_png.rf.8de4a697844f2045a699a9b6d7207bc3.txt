The X-ray image demonstrates a possible proximal humeral fracture, characterized by displacement and irregularity in the bony architecture of the humerus near its head. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the shoulder joint, indicating a potential associated hematoma or injury to the surrounding musculature. The acromion appears intact, but there is a subtle change in contour that may suggest an incomplete or undisplaced fracture in the vicinity, warranting further evaluation for stability.
