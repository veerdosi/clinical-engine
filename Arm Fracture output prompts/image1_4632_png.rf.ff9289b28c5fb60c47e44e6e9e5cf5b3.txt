The x-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the left hand, specifically highlighting the metacarpal and phalangeal regions. There is noticeable soft tissue swelling adjacent to the third digit, suggestive of possible tenosynovitis or collateral ligament injury. The alignment of the phalanges appears compromised, indicating a potential fracture or displacement that requires further evaluation.
