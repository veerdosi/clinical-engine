The X-ray image presents a clear view of the forearm, including both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a fracture observed in the midshaft region of the radius, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone and surrounding soft tissue edema, suggestive of an acute injury. Additionally, there is no evidence of malalignment or significant angular deformity in the ulna, indicating it remains intact despite the associated injury to the radius.
