The X-ray image shows the right wrist in a lateral view, displaying an angulated fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a distinct disruption of the cortical bone. There is also mild displacement of the fracture fragments, suggesting instability, which is consistent with a potential Colles' fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted around the wrist joint, indicating possible contusion or ligamentous injury associated with the trauma.
