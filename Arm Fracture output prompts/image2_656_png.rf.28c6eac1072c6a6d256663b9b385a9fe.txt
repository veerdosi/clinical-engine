The X-ray image displays an apparent abnormality in the humerus, characterized by an irregular fracture line that suggests a potential acute or chronic injury. Additionally, there is observable callus formation around the fracture site, indicating a healing response consistent with a bony injury. Edema may also be noted in the surrounding soft tissue, which can be indicative of inflammatory changes associated with the underlying bony pathology.
