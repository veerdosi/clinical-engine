The X-ray image demonstrates a well-defined cortical disruption in the distal radius, indicative of a possible fracture or significant traumatic injury. There is also evidence of swelling in the surrounding soft tissue, suggestive of a hematoma or inflammatory response. Additionally, the alignment of the ulna appears normal, but any accompanying changes in joint space should be evaluated for potential associated injuries.
