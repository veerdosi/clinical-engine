The X-ray image demonstrates the left forearm, specifically highlighting both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of a deformity characterized by cortical disruption and angulation, suggestive of a possible fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the radial head appears compromised, indicating potential joint involvement, which may be a sign of associated pathologies such as a fracture-dislocation complex.
