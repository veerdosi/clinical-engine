The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the left elbow joint, revealing the humerus, radius, and ulna in their anatomical positions. Notably, there is a prominence in the region of the olecranon, which may indicate the presence of an olecranon fracture or possible avulsion related to the triceps tendon. Joint space appears intact, but any signs of effusion or abnormalities in the surrounding soft tissues cannot be assessed from this image alone.
