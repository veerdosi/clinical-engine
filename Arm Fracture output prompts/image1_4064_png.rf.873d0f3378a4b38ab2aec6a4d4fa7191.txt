The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique fracture of the distal femur near the knee joint. There is notable displacement of the fracture fragments, suggesting instability and potential compromise of the surrounding soft tissue structures. Furthermore, joint effusion may be indicated by the altered appearance of the joint space, raising concern for associated ligamentous injury or hemorrhage.
