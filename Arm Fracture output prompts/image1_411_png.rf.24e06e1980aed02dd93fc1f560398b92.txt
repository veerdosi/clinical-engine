The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of a left wrist and hand, showing the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there is a visible osseous irregularity in the region of the scaphoid bone, suggestive of a possible fracture or avascular necrosis. Additionally, there appears to be a misalignment or deformity of the distal radius, indicative of potential complications such as malunion or post-traumatic changes.
