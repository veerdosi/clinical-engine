The X-ray shows a lateral view of the right wrist, revealing the distal radius and ulna. There is evidence of a distal radius fracture characterized by a dorsal angulation and possible comminution, which may suggest significant trauma to the wrist area. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no visible signs of osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the surrounding joints.
