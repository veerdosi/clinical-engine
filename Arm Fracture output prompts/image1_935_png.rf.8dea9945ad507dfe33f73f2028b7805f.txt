The X-ray image presents bilateral views of the hands, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notable findings include the alignment of the proximal and distal phalanges, showing no evident malalignment or dislocation. There is a potential indication of soft tissue swelling around the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may suggest an inflammatory or traumatic process, warranting further clinical correlation.
