The X-ray image displays the right hand, focusing on the metacarpal and phalangeal bones. There is evidence of a distal phalanx fracture, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity of the bone and an altered alignment of the phalanx. Additionally, there appears to be soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, indicative of potential soft tissue injury or inflammation.
