The x-ray image depicts the left hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges of the index finger. Notably, there is evidence of a fracture in the proximal phalanx, as indicated by the disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. Adjacent soft tissue swelling may suggest the presence of a hematoma or inflammation in response to the injury.
