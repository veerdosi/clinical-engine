The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of the hand, revealing the phalanges and metacarpals in detail. Notably, there is evidence of potential osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis in the proximal interphalangeal joints. Additionally, there may be signs of a previous fracture, as indicated by irregularities in bone continuity and altered cortical margins around the fifth metacarpal.
