The x-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical continuity and possible displacement. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling in the surrounding area, which may indicate associated soft tissue injury. Additionally, the alignment of the ulnar styloid process suggests potential involvement of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, which may complicate the overall assessment of the wrist joint stability.
