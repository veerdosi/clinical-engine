The X-ray image presents the bones of the forearm and proximal hand, revealing well-formed cortical and medullary structures in the radius and ulnar shafts. Notably, there appears to be an angulated fracture in the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and possible displacement of bone fragments, indicative of a recent traumatic event. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no signs of degenerative changes or dislocation evident in the remaining wrist joint complex.
