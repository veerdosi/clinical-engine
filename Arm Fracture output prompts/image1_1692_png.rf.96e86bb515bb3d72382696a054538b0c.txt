The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left forearm, demonstrating the radius and ulna. Notable in the image is an area of increased radiolucency around the distal end of the radius, suggestive of an underlying pathological process, such as a potential fracture or osteolytic lesion. Assessment of the joint space reveals possible joint effusion at the wrist, indicating inflammation or trauma affecting the surrounding soft tissues.
