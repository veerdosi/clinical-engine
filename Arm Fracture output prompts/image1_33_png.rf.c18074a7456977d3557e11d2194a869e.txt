The X-ray image exhibits a lateral view of the right forearm, displaying both the radius and ulna. Notably, there is an observable misalignment of the distal radius, which may indicate a potential fracture or a malalignment due to a previous injury. Additionally, the joint space at the radial and ulnar articulation appears to be preserved, with no evident signs of osteoarthritis or significant degenerative changes.
