The X-ray image displays evidence of a prominent joint effusion within the knee joint, as indicated by the increased soft tissue opacity surrounding the articulation. Furthermore, there are signs of possible osteoarthritic changes, such as joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, particularly in the medial compartment. Additionally, the presence of any potential bony lesions or fractures should be evaluated, indicated by irregularities in the cortical margins and trabecular patterns.
