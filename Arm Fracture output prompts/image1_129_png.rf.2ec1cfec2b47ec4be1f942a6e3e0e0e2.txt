The X-ray image depicts the region of the humerus and shoulder girdle, with particular attention to the alignment of the glenohumeral joint. There is evidence of a potential fracture or dislocation, characterized by abnormal angulation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid fossa. Additionally, periosteal reaction may be observed, indicating possible underlying trauma to the soft tissue structure surrounding the bone.
