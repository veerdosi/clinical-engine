The radiograph displays the left forearm, revealing the presence of an internal fixation device, indicative of previous surgical intervention. There is evidence of a stable fracture in the distal radius, with appropriate alignment of the fracture fragments noted around the metallic plate and screws. Surrounding the surgical site, there are no signs of acute complications such as hardware failure or significant dislocation, and the soft tissues appear unremarkable on this imaging.
