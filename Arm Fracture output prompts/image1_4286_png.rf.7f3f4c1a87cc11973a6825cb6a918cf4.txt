The X-ray image presents the left shoulder, demonstrating a limited view of the glenohumeral joint and surrounding bony structures. Notably, there appears to be a potential acromioclavicular joint degeneration characterized by subacromial space narrowing, which may indicate impingement or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, signs of osseous abnormalities such as irregularities in the greater tuberosity could suggest prior injury or degenerative changes in the proximal humerus.
