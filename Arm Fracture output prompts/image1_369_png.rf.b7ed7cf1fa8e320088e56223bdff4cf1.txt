The X-ray image shows the left elbow joint, highlighting both the humerus and the forearm bones, the radius and ulna, in a lateral view. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal humerus, with potential displacement noted at the fracture site. Additionally, there may be signs of joint effusion in the surrounding soft tissues, which could indicate trauma or inflammation associated with the fracture.
