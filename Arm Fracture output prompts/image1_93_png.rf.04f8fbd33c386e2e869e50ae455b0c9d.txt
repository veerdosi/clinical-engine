The X-ray image depicts a left elbow joint in a lateral view, showcasing the alignment and integrity of the distal humerus, proximal ulna, and radius. Notably, there appears to be irregularity in the cortical bone of the distal humerus, which may suggest the presence of a bone lesion or potential fractural involvement. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observed, indicative of possible degenerative changes or inflammatory conditions affecting the synovial structures.
