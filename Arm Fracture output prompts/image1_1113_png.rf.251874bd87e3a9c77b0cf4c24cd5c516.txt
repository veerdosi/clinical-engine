The X-ray image displays the phalangeal structures of the left hand, specifically emphasizing the middle and distal phalanges of the index and middle fingers. Notable is the presence of possible signs of osteoarthritis, indicated by the presence of joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis around the first metacarpophalangeal joints. Additionally, there may be evidence of a previous fracture, as seen by any irregularities in the cortical margins and changes in bone density in the area of interest.
