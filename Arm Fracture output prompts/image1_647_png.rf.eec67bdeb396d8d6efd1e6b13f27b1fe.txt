The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left knee joint, revealing the presence of joint effusion, characterized by an increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region. The femoral condyles and the proximal tibia exhibit normal bony architecture, but there are subtle signs of osteophyte formation, suggestive of early degenerative changes. Furthermore, the patellar articulation appears well-aligned, although slight soft tissue swelling is observed surrounding the joint, which may indicate underlying synovitis or inflammatory pathology.
