The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal ossification pattern within the knee joint, characterized by the presence of an osteophyte formation on the femoral condyles. There is also a decrease in joint space, indicative of potential osteoarthritis affecting the tibiofemoral articulation. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is observed, which suggests underlying degenerative changes in the articular cartilage.
