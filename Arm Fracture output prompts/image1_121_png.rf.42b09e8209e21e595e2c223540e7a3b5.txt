The X-ray image displays the right hand in a posteroanterior view, highlighting the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones. Notable in this image is the presence of a likely fracture in the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone. Additionally, there may be signs of possible joint effusion in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the same digit, evidenced by soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint space.
