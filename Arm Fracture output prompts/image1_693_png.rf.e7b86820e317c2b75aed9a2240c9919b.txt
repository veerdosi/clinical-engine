The X-ray image of the left elbow displays a hyperextended joint angle, which may suggest the presence of a potential elbow dislocation or subluxation. Notably, the relationship between the humerus and the ulna appears altered, raising concerns for instability or ligamentous injury. Additionally, any surrounding peri-articular soft tissue edema or effusion is not visually assessable, but could be clinically relevant to the evaluation of joint integrity and injury severity.
