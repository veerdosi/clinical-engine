The X-ray demonstrates a right wrist with evidence of internal fixation, indicated by the presence of a metal plate and multiple screws applied to the distal radius. The surrounding bony structures show signs of post-surgical changes, including callus formation, which may suggest a healing response. There is a potential indication of fracture malalignment or non-union involving the proximal carpal region, as assessed by the alignment of the carpal bones.
