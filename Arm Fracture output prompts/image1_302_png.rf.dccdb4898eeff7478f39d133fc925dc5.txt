The X-ray image of the right lower extremity reveals the femur, tibia, and fibula, providing a clear view of the bone structure. Upon examination, there are no evident fractures or acute bony lesions in the femur or tibia, suggesting integrity of the cortical bone. However, the alignment of the long bones should be assessed for any signs of malalignment or deformity that could indicate underlying structural issues such as varus or valgus deformity.
