The X-ray image depicts the right hand in an extended position, revealing the osseous structures of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notably, there is evidence of a potential fracture in the metacarpal region, characterized by cortical interruption and displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be indicated, suggesting an associated contusion or injury to the surrounding structures.
