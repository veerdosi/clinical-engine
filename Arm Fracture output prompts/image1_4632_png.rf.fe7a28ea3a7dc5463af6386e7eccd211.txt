The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormality in the distal phalanx of the left little finger, characterized by subluxation at the distal interphalangeal joint. There is notable displacement of the joint surfaces, indicating possible ligamentous injury or instability. Additionally, the presence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the joint may suggest an inflammatory response or underlying trauma.
