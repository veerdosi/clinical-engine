The provided X-ray images show the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna of the forearm. There is evidence of a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the cortical integrity and a distinct fracture line. Additionally, the alignment of the wrist joint appears altered, suggesting potential associated ligamentous injury or instability.

The images also highlight the presence of some soft tissue swelling around the fracture site, indicative of an inflammatory response. Notably, the carpal bones demonstrate normal anatomical alignment and morphology, with no signs of osteoarthritis or other degenerative changes. The radiographic density appears normal, with no evidence of underlying bony lesions.
