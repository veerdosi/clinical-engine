The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right elbow joint, demonstrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there appears to be a potential fracture in the distal humerus, with evidence of surrounding soft tissue swelling indicative of localized inflammation. Additionally, the alignment of the olecranon suggests signs of possible joint effusion or displacement, warranting further clinical evaluation for potential instability or ligamentous injury.
