The X-ray image shows the left upper extremity, specifically highlighting the humerus and the elbow joint. There is evidence of a fracture in the mid-shaft of the humerus, characterized by a break in cortical continuity, which may indicate a recent traumatic incident. Additionally, abnormal alignment at the elbow joint suggests potential displacement, complicating the overall integrity of the surrounding soft tissue and joint structures.
