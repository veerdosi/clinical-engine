The X-ray image of the elbow joint reveals joint effusion with an increased radiolucency in the area surrounding the joint space, which may suggest the presence of synovitis or other inflammatory conditions. Additionally, there are signs of potential osteophyte formation at the margins, indicating chronic degenerative changes commonly associated with osteoarthritis. The cortical bone appears intact; however, there is an observable irregularity in the joint surface contour, which could indicate underlying pathology such as chondromalacia or other joint disorders.
