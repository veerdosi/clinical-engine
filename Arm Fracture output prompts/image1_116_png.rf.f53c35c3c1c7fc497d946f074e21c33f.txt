The image presents a lateral x-ray view of the forearm, capturing the distal radius and ulna. Observations indicate a significant angulation at the midshaft of the ulna, consistent with a ulnar shaft fracture, characterized by a possible fracture line. Additionally, there is periosteal reaction evident around the fracture site, suggestive of ongoing healing processes in response to the injury.
