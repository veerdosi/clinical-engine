The image presents an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the elbow joint, revealing a potential osteochondral defect characterized by irregularities in the articular surfaces of the humerus and the proximal radius. There is observable joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency in the cubital fossa, which may suggest underlying inflammatory pathology, such as synovitis or an acute inflammatory process. Notably, there is evidence of possible avulsion or fragmentation at the insertion of the lateral collateral ligament, which may indicate a ligamentous injury related to trauma or overuse.
