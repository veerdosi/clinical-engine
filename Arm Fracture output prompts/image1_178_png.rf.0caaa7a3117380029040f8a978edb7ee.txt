The X-ray image exhibits a lateral view of the left humerus and elbow joint, demonstrating appropriate anatomical alignment of the long bone, with no evident dislocation. There is a notable presence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the elbow joint, which may suggest a possible inflammatory process or an acute traumatic event. Additionally, slight irregularities at the distal humerus could indicate a potential fracture or osteoarthritis that warrants further investigation.
