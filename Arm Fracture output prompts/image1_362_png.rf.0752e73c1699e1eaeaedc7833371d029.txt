The X-ray image of the right forearm shows a mid-shaft fracture of the radius and ulna, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone. Additionally, there are two metallic rods present, indicative of an internal fixation device used for stabilization. Signs of potential callus formation may be seen surrounding the fracture site, suggesting a healing response to the bone injury.
