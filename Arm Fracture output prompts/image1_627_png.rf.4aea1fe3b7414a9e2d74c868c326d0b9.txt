The X-ray image demonstrates the right arm, specifically highlighting the humerus, shoulder, and proximal radius and ulna. Notable is the presence of an angular deformity in the humerus, suggestive of a deformity that may be consistent with a traumatic injury or pathological process. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is observed surrounding the elbow joint, which could indicate an inflammatory response or potential hematoma formation.
