The X-ray image displays the distal humerus and proximal radius, revealing a notable fracture at the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortices. Additionally, the alignment of the elbow joint appears compromised, suggesting potential ligamentous involvement or associated soft tissue injury. No significant bone displacement is observed, but the presence of a hematoma adjacent to the fracture site may indicate localized hemorrhage, warranting further clinical evaluation.
