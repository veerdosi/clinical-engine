The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the right elbow joint, highlighting the osseous structures including the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notable is the presence of an effusion in the joint space, indicated by increased radiolucency, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma. Additionally, there appears to be a potential fracture line in the radial head region, necessitating further evaluation for acute or chronic injury.
