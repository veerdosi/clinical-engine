The radiographic image displays a left wrist in an anteroposterior view, where the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges are visible. There is a notable involvement of the distal radius, which may exhibit signs consistent with a fracture or malalignment, particularly in the region of the wrist joint. Joint spaces appear to be preserved, but any irregularities or occlusions in the cortical margins should be analyzed for potential pathological changes or deformities.
