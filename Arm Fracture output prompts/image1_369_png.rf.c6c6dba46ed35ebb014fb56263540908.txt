The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left elbow, highlighting the distal humerus, proximal radius, and ulnar structures. There is an observable fracture across the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a discontinuity in the radiopaque cortex, indicative of a possible comminuted or displaced fracture. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, raising the suspicion for associated hematoma or contusion in the surrounding musculature.
