The X-ray image demonstrates an anterior view of the forearm, revealing the presence of an internal fixation device in the distal radius. There is evidence of a mid-shaft fracture of the radius, indicated by the alignment of the fragments and the metallic hardware securing them. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, but any associated edema or callus formation is not distinctly visualized in this projection.
