The X-ray image depicts the right elbow joint, highlighting the olecranon process of the ulna and the distal humerus. Notably, there is an irregular density observed in the region around the joint, which may suggest an underlying pathologic condition such as osteoarthritis or a potential osteochondroma. The joint space appears narrowed, indicating potential degenerative changes consistent with chronic joint disease.
