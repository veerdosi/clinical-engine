The X-ray image depicts the phalanges of the fingers, showing a potentially visible fracture line in one of the proximal phalanges. There is evidence of increased soft tissue swelling around the affected area, suggesting underlying trauma or inflammation. Additionally, joint alignment appears to be intact, with no signs of dislocation observed within the metacarpophalangeal joints.
