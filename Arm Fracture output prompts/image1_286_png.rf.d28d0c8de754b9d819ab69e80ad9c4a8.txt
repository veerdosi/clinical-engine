The X-ray image demonstrates a left humerus with a notable subcapital fracture, characterized by a disruption of the normal cortical continuity at the neck region. The alignment of the humeral head appears compromised, indicating potential displacement that may affect the surrounding soft tissue structures. Additionally, there are signs of surrounding edema, suggestive of an inflammatory response to the traumatic injury.
