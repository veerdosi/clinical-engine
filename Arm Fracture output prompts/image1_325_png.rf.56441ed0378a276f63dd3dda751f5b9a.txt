The X-ray image reveals a significant diaphyseal fracture of the humerus with visible displacement of the bone fragments. There is also an intramedullary nail present, suggesting non-union fixation, indicative of a previous intervention to stabilize the fracture. Surrounding soft tissue shows signs of edema, and there appears to be an absence of callus formation, which may imply a delay in healing or potential complications related to the fracture management.
