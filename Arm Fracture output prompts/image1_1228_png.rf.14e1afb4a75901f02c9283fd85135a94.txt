The X-ray reveals a right hand with five phalanges, displaying the typical anatomical structure. Notably, there is evidence of an angulated fracture in the middle phalanx of one of the digits, characterized by cortical disruption and a potential displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observable in the surrounding area, indicating possible traumatic injury or inflammation.
