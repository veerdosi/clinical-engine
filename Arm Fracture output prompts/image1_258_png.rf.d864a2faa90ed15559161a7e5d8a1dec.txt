The X-ray image reveals a notable deformity in the distal femur characterized by varus angulation, which may indicate underlying osteoarthritis or post-traumatic changes. Additionally, there appears to be an irregularity along the cortical bone surface, suggesting the presence of potential bone lesions or periosteal reactions. This could point towards conditions such as osteomyelitis or neoplastic processes requiring further diagnostic evaluation for a definitive assessment.
