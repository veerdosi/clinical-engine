The X-ray image displays a well-defined fracture of the radius in the mid-shaft region, with noticeable angulation present. There is also evidence of a potential subsequent radial displacement, which may suggest instability at the fracture site. The surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable, with no overt signs of edema or hematoma evident in the peripheries.
