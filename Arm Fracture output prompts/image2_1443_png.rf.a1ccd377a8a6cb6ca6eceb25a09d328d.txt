The X-ray image displays an acute angulated fracture of the midshaft of the ulna, characterized by a clear disruption of the cortical bone. There are indications of potential associated soft tissue swelling and displacement of the fracture fragments, likely complicating the injury. Additionally, there may be an elbow effusion suggested by the altered alignment and radiolucency near the joint space, indicating possible joint involvement.
