The X-ray demonstrates a distal radius fracture that has been internally stabilized with a plate and screws, indicating surgical intervention. The alignment of the fractured segments appears to be maintained by the fixation device, with no signs of displacement evident at the fracture site. Additionally, there appears to be some soft tissue swelling consistent with a post-operative recovery phase, but no overt signs of infection are visible in the imaging provided.
