There is notable evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the presence of a soft tissue shadow adjacent to the olecranon, which may signify an inflammatory process. Additionally, the articular surfaces exhibit signs of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
