The X-ray image presents the right hand with visibility of the phalanges and metacarpal bones. Notable findings include possible joint effusion at the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may indicate inflammatory changes or trauma. Additionally, any abnormalities in bone density or contour could suggest underlying osteopenia or deformities such as malunion or nonunion of the bony structures.
