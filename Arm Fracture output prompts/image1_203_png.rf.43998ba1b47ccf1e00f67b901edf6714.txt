The image displays an oblique radiograph of the right forearm, demonstrating both the radius and ulna. There is notable cortical disruption along the mid-shaft of the radius, indicating a potential fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the forearm bones appears compromised, raising the possibility of malunion or angulation deformities.
