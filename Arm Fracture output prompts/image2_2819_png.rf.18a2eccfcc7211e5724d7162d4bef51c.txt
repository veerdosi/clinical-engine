The X-ray image displays the lateral view of the knee joint, where signs of osteoarthritis are evident, characterized by joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes at the margins of the femur and tibia. There is also an observable effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency around the joint, suggesting potential synovial inflammation. Additionally, the image reveals subchondral sclerosis beneath the articular surfaces, indicating chronic stress and degenerative changes in the osseous structures.
