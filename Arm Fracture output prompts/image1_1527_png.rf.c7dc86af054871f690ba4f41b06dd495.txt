The X-ray image reveals a significant radial fracture, indicated by a distinct discontinuity in the cortical bone along the diaphysis of the radius. There is observable callus formation, suggesting a healing response to the fracture, which could indicate a recent injury. Additionally, there appears to be slight displacement of the fracture fragments, which may warrant further evaluation for potential surgical intervention.
