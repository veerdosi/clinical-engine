The X-ray demonstrates an anterior-posterior view of the left knee joint, revealing the presence of metallic hardware indicating prior surgical intervention, likely internal fixation due to a fracture. There is evidence of malalignment in the bony structures surrounding the knee, with the patella in a suboptimal position, suggesting potential complications such as post-traumatic arthritis. Additionally, the joint space appears narrowed, which may indicate degenerative changes associated with prior trauma or surgical stabilization procedures.
