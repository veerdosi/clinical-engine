The radiographic image depicts the left knee joint in a lateral view, demonstrating a potential fracture in the distal femur, just proximal to the knee joint. Notably, there is a slight displacement observed, suggesting instability in the fracture pattern, which may indicate a comminuted fracture. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident around the joint area, indicating possible associated soft tissue injury that often accompanies traumatic fractures.
