The X-ray image depicts the right hand, with particular emphasis on the phalanges and metacarpals of the fingers. There is evidence of an angular deformity in one of the proximal phalanges, suggestive of possible malalignment or fracture healing. Additionally, joint spaces appear narrowed in certain areas, which may indicate degenerative changes or the presence of arthritic conditions affecting the bones and surrounding soft tissues.
