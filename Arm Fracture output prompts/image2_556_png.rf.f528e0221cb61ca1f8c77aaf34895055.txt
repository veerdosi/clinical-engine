The image displays a lateral view of the right femur (R), indicating the presence of an intramedullary nail and multiple screws utilized for stabilization. Notable is the alignment of the femoral shaft, which appears to be stable with no evidence of malunion or nonunion. Surrounding the hardware, there may be signs of surrounding soft tissue reaction, which could suggest a response to the surgical intervention.
