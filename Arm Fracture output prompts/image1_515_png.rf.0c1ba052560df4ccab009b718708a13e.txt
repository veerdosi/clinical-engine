The X-ray demonstrates an abnormal joint alignment at the distal humerus, characterized by an irregular joint space and possible osteophyte formation, suggestive of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis). Additionally, there is evidence of bone proliferation and changes in joint contour, indicating potential joint effusion or synovitis. The presence of subchondral sclerosis in the region surrounding the joint may further indicate chronic changes associated with ongoing degenerative processes.
