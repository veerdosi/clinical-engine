The x-ray image reveals a clear fracture of the ulnar shaft, characterized by a transverse break demonstrating significant displacement. There is also evidence of cortical disruption and potential comminution at the fracture site, which may suggest instability. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, indicated by potential periosteal reaction adjacent to the fracture.
