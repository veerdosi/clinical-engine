The X-ray presented reveals an apparent fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a transverse line extending through the metaphysis. There is notable angulation at the fracture site, which suggests possible displacement of the fracture fragments. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, indicating a potential inflammatory response associated with the injury.
