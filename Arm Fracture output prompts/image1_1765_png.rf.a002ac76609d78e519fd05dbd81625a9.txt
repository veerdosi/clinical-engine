The radiograph displays an oblique fracture of the right femur, characterized by an incomplete break causing angular deformity of the bone shaft. There is notable periosteal reaction along the fracture line, which may indicate remodeling or associated hematoma formation. Joint alignment appears intact, suggesting no involvement of articular surfaces, and the overall stability of the fracture has been assessed.
