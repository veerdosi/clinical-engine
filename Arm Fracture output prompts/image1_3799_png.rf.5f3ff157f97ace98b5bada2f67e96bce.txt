The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the shoulder joint, revealing a possible glenohumeral joint dislocation. There is an apparent anterior displacement of the humeral head relative to the glenoid, suggesting instability at the shoulder. Accompanying findings may include soft tissue edema around the joint and possible disruption of the rotator cuff tendons.
