The X-ray image depicts an elbow joint that has undergone surgical intervention, evidenced by the presence of an orthopedic plate and screws. There is a visible metallosis indicating the placement of internal fixation devices, which is consistent with a history of fracture repair. The joint space appears preserved, yet there may be signs of potential post-surgical changes, such as callus formation around the fracture site.
