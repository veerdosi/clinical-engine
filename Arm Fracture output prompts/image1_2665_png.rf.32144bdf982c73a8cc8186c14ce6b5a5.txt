The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, highlighting the glenohumeral articulation and the surrounding bony structures. There is evidence of a possible acute rotator cuff tear, indicated by the presence of a fluid accumulation and potential displacement of the humeral head. Additionally, signs of subacromial impingement are noted, characterized by a narrowing in the subacromial space and associated degenerative changes in the acromion.
