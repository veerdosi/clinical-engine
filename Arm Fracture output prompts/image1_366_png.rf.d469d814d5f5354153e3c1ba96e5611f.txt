The X-ray image reveals multiple phalangeal bones with notable displacement in the distal phalanx, indicative of a possible fracture. There is also evidence of a radiopaque foreign body, which may suggest prior trauma or an embedded object in the soft tissue near the affected digits. Additionally, the alignment of the metacarpals appears intact, with no signs of osteophyte formation or erosive changes that would suggest degenerative joint disease.
