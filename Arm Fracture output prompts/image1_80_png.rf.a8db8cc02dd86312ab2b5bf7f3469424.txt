The image presents an X-ray of the left knee joint, displaying the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency in the suprapatellar region, which may suggest the presence of synovial fluid accumulation. Additionally, there is a noticeable osteophyte formation at the margins of the femoral condyles, consistent with osteoarthritis in the knee.
