The X-ray image reveals a significant angular deformity observed in the midshaft of the femur, indicating a possible varus or valgus alignment. There is evidence of cortical bone irregularities and periosteal reaction consistent with potential fractures or stress-related changes. Soft tissue swelling is also noted around the affected area, suggesting an inflammatory response possibly associated with trauma.
