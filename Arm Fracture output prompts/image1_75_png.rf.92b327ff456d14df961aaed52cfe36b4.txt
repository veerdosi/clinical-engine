The X-ray image displays the left humerus and forearm bones, with clear visualization of the radius and ulna. Notable in the radiographic assessment is the presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius, characterized by displacement and potential angulation. Additionally, signs of periosteal reaction are visible, indicating a response to the fracture and underlying bone trauma.
