The X-ray image displays the right humerus, revealing an irregularity in the distal aspect of the bone. There is notable lucency surrounding the joint space, which may suggest the presence of osteolytic lesions potentially indicative of an underlying pathological process such as osteomyelitis or a benign tumor. Additionally, the contour of the joint appears altered, suggesting possible joint effusion or degenerative changes related to conditions like arthritis.
