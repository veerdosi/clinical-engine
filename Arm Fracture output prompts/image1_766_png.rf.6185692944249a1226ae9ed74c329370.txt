The X-ray image presents an anteroposterior view of the right knee joint, demonstrating the femur, tibia, and fibula in their anatomical positions. There is evidence of joint effusion, indicated by the increased radiolucency at the suprapatellar bursa, which may suggest underlying inflammatory processes such as synovitis or secondary osteoarthritis. Additionally, any osteophyte formation or joint space narrowing is not fully discernible in this projection, but the overall alignment of the knee joint appears intact without evident fractures or dislocations.
