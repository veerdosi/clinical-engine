The X-ray image of the left arm reveals a significant anterior angulation of the mid-shaft of the humerus, indicating a possible diaphyseal fracture. There is also evidence of soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest acute inflammatory changes. Additionally, alignment of the radial and ulnar bones appears intact without visible fracture lines, indicating that any injury is likely localized to the humerus.
