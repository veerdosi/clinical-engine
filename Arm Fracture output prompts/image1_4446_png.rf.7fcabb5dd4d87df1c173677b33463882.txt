The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of a right hand in an anteroposterior view, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there appears to be an angulation or malalignment of the fourth and fifth digits, which may suggest the presence of a digital deformity or prior fracture not fully healed. Additionally, the articulation of the first carpometacarpal joint can be evaluated for signs of osteoarthritis or joint effusion, though these specific conditions cannot be definitively assessed without further clinical correlation.
