The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the left hand, with a particular emphasis on the distal phalanx of the digit. Notably, there appears to be a significant angulation at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate a potential deformity or abnormal alignment. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissue structures are unremarkable, but careful evaluation of the joint spaces is warranted to assess for any signs of degenerative changes or effusion.
