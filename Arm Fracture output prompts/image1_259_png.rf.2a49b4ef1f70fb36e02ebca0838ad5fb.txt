The X-ray images depict both the anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views of the forearm, highlighting the radius and ulna. The presence of a mid-shaft fracture in the radius is evident, characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical continuity and associated displacement. Additionally, there is an indication of potential soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggestive of an acute traumatic injury.
