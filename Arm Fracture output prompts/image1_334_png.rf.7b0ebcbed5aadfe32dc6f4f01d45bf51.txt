The x-ray image demonstrates the right hand, showing the phalanges of the fingers in a lateral view. There is a notable joint effusion in the interphalangeal joints, which may suggest the presence of inflammatory processes or possible degenerative changes. Additionally, there is evidence of potential malalignment of the proximal phalanges indicating possible fracture or dislocation affecting proper anatomical configuration.
