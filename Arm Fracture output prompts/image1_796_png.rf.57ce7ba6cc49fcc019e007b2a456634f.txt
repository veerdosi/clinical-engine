The X-ray image demonstrates the left forearm, displaying the radius and ulna in a lateral view. There is a notable angular deformity, indicative of possible malalignment or fracture at the midshaft of the ulna. Additionally, the articulation at the distal end of the radius and the wrist joint appears intact, with no signs of dislocation or other traumatic injury.
