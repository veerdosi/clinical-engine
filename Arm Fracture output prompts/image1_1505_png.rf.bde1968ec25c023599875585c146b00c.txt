The X-ray image reveals a right hand with multiple metallic fixation screws in the proximal phalanges of the second and third digits, indicative of previous surgical intervention, possibly for fracture stabilization. There is noted periosteal reaction and slight alterations in the bone density surrounding the fixation sites, which may suggest a history of trauma or surgical repair. The joint spaces appear intact, with no evident osseous deformities or signs of acute pathology such as fractures or arthritis observed in the remaining phalanges and metacarpals.
