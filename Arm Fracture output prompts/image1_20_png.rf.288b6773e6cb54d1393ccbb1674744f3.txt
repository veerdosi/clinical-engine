The X-ray depicts the left shoulder joint, highlighting the humeral head and the glenoid cavity. There is a visible fracture through the surgical neck of the humerus, with associated displacement suggesting a potential proximal humeral fracture. Additionally, there are signs of subacromial impingement, indicated by soft tissue swelling in the region surrounding the acromion and the greater tuberosity of the humerus.
