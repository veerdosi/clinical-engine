The X-ray image displays an anteroposterior view of the right forearm, including the wrist and hand. There is evidence of a distal radius fracture, characterized by cortical discontinuity and possible misalignment of the fragment. Soft tissue swelling is also noted around the fracture site, suggesting a reactive process indicative of trauma.
