The X-ray image presented shows a clear view of the right femur and knee joint. There is notable osteopenia observed in the subtrochantic region of the femur, along with a potential alignment issue attributable to a valgus deformity at the knee. The knee joint demonstrates possible joint space narrowing, which may suggest the presence of degenerative changes or osteoarthritis affecting the articular surfaces.
