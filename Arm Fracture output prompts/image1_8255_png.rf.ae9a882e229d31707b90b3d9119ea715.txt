The radiograph displays an image of the humerus, demonstrating the presence of an intramedullary nail utilized for stabilization following a fracture. There is evident cortical bone disruption in the midshaft region of the humerus, suggestive of a previous oste fracture. Additionally, there is potential callus formation around the surgical site, indicating the healing phase of the bone post-surgery.
