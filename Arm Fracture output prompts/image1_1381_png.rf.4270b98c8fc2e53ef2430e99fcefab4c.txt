The X-ray demonstrates a right forearm with a visible fracture of the distal radius and ulna, indicating a potential osteosynthesis intervention. A metallic fixation device, including a plate and screws, is noted along the fracture site, suggesting a surgical repair to stabilize the fractured bones. There is also evidence of callus formation around the fracture, indicating a healing process post-surgery.
