The X-ray image depicts the right shoulder joint, with a focus on the humerus and glenohumeral articulation. There is a notable prominence of the acromion process, which may suggest subacromial impingement or a possible acromial spur. The surrounding soft tissues exhibit signs of edema, potentially indicating inflammation associated with rotator cuff tendinopathy.
