The image depicts an X-ray of the left elbow joint, showing the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an evident joint effusion and potential disruption in the continuity of the cortex of the lateral condyle of the humerus, suggestive of an incomplete fracture or osteochondral injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is noted surrounding the joint, indicating possible acute inflammatory changes consistent with conditions such as elbow trauma or synovitis.
