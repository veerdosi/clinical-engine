The X-ray depicts an elbow joint in a lateral view, revealing an abnormal alignment of the joint surfaces. There is evidence of an osteochondral injury at the capitellum, which may indicate underlying conditions such as osteochondritis dissecans. Additionally, there is hyperplastic bony formation at the olecranon, suggestive of possible tendinopathy or chronic stress at the lateral epicondyle.
