The X-ray image depicts an elbow joint in a flexed position, with clear visualization of the humerus, radius, and ulna bones. Notable is the presence of a fracture in the radial head, characterized by a discontinuity in the cortical bone and adjacent soft tissue swelling, indicating possible associated traumatic injury. Additionally, there may be an effusion seen within the joint space, suggesting a possible hemorrhagic or inflammatory response.
