The X-ray image reveals a transverse fracture of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger, characterized by a complete discontinuity across the diaphysis. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the injury, which may indicate associated contusion or hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the joint surfaces appears intact, suggesting that there is no significant displacement of the fractured bone segments.
