The X-ray image depicts an elbow joint, showing the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. There is a discernible appearance of an osteophyte at the olecranon process, suggestive of a degenerative joint condition, possibly osteoarthritis. Additionally, there may be subchondral sclerosis surrounding the joint surfaces, indicating increased bone density related to chronic stress or degeneration.
