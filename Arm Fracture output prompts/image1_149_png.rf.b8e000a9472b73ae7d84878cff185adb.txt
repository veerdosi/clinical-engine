The x-ray image displays the left elbow joint in an anteroposterior view, revealing the relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an observable joint effusion, indicated by an increased radiolucency around the elbow, which may suggest synovitis or trauma. Additionally, mild osteophyte formation is noted at the olecranon process, characteristic of early degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
