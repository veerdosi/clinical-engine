The X-ray displays a left elbow joint with a metallic fixation device indicating a history of surgical intervention, likely for a fracture. There are signs of callus formation around the area of the fixation, suggesting the presence of a healing fracture. Additionally, no acute bony abnormalities are observed, but the alignment of the joint appears to be affected, which may indicate post-surgical changes or malunion.
