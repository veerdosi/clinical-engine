The X-ray image depicts an anterior-posterior view of the distal humerus and proximal forearm, revealing the alignment of the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a potential indication of an olecranon fracture at the elbow joint, characterized by irregularities in the bony contour. Additionally, signs of possible radial head involvement may be observed, which could suggest associated trauma in the articulation.
