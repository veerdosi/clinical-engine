The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the right hand, demonstrating the bony architecture of the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable joint spaces appear normal, but there is a potential malalignment in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the third digit, indicating possible subluxation or dislocation. Additionally, there is mild evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fourth digit, which may suggest an inflammatory process or contusion.
