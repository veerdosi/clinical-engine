The X-ray image demonstrates the right upper extremity, revealing both the humerus and forearm bones. Notably, there is a visible radiolucency indicative of a potential fracture in the distal part of the humerus, with possible misalignment of the fracture fragments. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed, suggesting inflammation commonly associated with acute traumatic injuries to the region.
