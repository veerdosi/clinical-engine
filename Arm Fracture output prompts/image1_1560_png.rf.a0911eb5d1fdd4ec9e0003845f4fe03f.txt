The X-ray image reveals a right shoulder joint with visible osseous structures, including the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notable is the presence of an irregularity in the contour of the humeral head, suggestive of possible degenerative changes or rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, the glenohumeral joint space appears narrowed, indicating potential glenohumeral osteoarthritis or other underlying joint disease processes.
