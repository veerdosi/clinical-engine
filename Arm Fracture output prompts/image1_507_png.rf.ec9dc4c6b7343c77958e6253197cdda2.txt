The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the wrist and hand, showcasing the carpal bones and proximal phalanges. Notably, there appears to be a presence of joint effusion at the radiocarpal joint, which may suggest an inflammatory process or post-traumatic change. The alignment of the metacarpals and phalanges appears intact, without visible malalignment or significant osseous deformity.
