The X-ray shows a lateral view of the proximal humerus, indicating the presence of an intramedullary nail with multiple locking screws in place. There is evidence of callus formation around the surgical site, which suggests a healing process following an osteosynthesis procedure likely performed to stabilize a humeral fracture. The alignment of the humeral head appears satisfactory; however, the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues cannot be assessed through this imaging modality.
