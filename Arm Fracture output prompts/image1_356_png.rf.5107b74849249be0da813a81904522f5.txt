The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the wrist, showcasing the carpal bones and distal radius and ulna. Notable in this image is a possible fracture line in the distal radius, indicating a potential fracture that may require further evaluation. Additionally, there is a suggestion of increased radiolucency in the scaphoid, which could imply the presence of a bone lesion or avascular necrosis.
