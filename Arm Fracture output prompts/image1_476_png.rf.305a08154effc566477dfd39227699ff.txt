The X-ray image depicts the left wrist and forearm, showing the distal radius and ulnar bones. There is a clear visibility of the carpal bones, as well as the alignment of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints. Notably, there appears to be an abnormality, potentially indicating a fracture or other pathology involving the radius or adjacent structures, warranting further examination.
