The X-ray image presents a left lower limb (as indicated by "L") showing the distal femur and proximal tibia region, revealing notable radiolucency in the bone structure. There is a visible cortical disruption, suggestive of a possible fracture with surrounding soft tissue swelling indicated by the haziness in adjacent soft tissue planes. Additionally, there may be signs of possible osteopenic changes, which could indicate diminished bone density, warranting further clinical correlation and evaluation.
