The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the hand, revealing a clear visualization of the phalanges and metacarpals. There is an evident disruption in the continuity of the distal phalanx, which may indicate a fracture, possibly involving soft tissue injury as evidenced by surrounding radiolucency. Additionally, the alignment of the finger bones appears altered, suggesting potential deformity or displacement related to the fracture.
