The X-ray image displays a left lower extremity, specifically focusing on the femur, tibia, and fibula. There is notable evidence of a deformity characterized by curvature along the shaft of the tibia, which may indicate a condition such as tibial bowing. Additionally, no acute fractures or joint effusion are observed, but the alignment of the bones suggests potential underlying structural abnormalities requiring further clinical evaluation.
