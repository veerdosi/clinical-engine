The X-ray image demonstrates an anterior-posterior (AP) view of the right shoulder, highlighting a notable joint effusion in the glenohumeral joint space, indicative of possible inflammatory or traumatic pathology. There is also evidence of cortical irregularity at the surgical area, suggesting prior surgical intervention or trauma, with soft tissue swelling evident around the shoulder joint. The visualized bony structures, including the humeral head and scapula, appear congruent but warrant further evaluation for any underlying fractures or degenerative changes in the context of the patient's clinical history.
