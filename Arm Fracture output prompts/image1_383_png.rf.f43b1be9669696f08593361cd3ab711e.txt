The X-ray images depict a significant fracture involving the distal humerus and proximal ulna, characterized by evident bone discontinuity and malalignment. There is an observable angular deformity of the forearm, suggesting a possible complication such as malunion or nonunion, which may impact functional mobility. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, indicating a reactive inflammatory process associated with the acute injury.
