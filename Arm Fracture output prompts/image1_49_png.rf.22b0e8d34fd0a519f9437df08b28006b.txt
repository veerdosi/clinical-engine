The X-ray reveals an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a disruption in the continuity of the cortical bone. There is noted periosteal reaction, suggesting an acute injury, and the alignment of the carpal bones appears normal without evidence of dislocation. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is present around the fracture site, indicating an associated contusion or hematoma.
