The X-ray image depicts an anteroposterior view of the left hand, illustrating the skeletal anatomy including the metacarpals and phalanges. Notable in the image are signs of possible osteoarthritis, indicated by joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and bone cysts, particularly at the base of the first metacarpal. Additionally, there appears to be evidence of marginal osteophyte formation at several interphalangeal joints, suggesting chronic degenerative changes within the joints of the hand.
