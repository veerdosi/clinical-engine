The radiographic image demonstrates the distal radius and ulna of the left arm, showing abnormal angulation in the midshaft region consistent with a possible diaphyseal fracture. Cortical disruption is evident, and there is a significant degree of edema surrounding the affected area, which may indicate an underlying fracture hematoma. Additionally, there are signs of abnormal trabecular patterns in the surrounding bone, raising suspicion for possible osteopenic changes.
