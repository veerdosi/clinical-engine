The radiograph depicts a lateral view of the elbow joint, which demonstrates a presence of metallic fixation devices indicative of prior surgical intervention, likely for an unstable fracture. There is an evident non-union or malunion of the distal humerus and proximal ulna, characterized by irregular bone alignment and signs of surrounding soft tissue edema. Furthermore, possible osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis may be noted at the joint surfaces, suggesting degenerative changes associated with chronic instability or post-traumatic arthritis.
