The X-ray image exhibits the left forearm of a patient with evidence of surgical intervention, as indicated by the presence of metallic fixation devices, including plates and screws. There is a visible fracture line across the distal radius, suggestive of a complex fracture pattern that may involve angulation or displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be inferred but is not explicitly shown, which is often associated with such fractures and surgical procedures.
