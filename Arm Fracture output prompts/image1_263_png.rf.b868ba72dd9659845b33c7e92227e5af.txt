The X-ray image presents the left hand, with a focus on the phalangeal anatomy. Notably, a non-displaced fracture is observed in the proximal phalanx of the 4th digit, characterized by cortical discontinuity and surrounding soft tissue edema. Additionally, there is a potential angulation noted at the fracture site, which may indicate a displacement that warrants further evaluation for possible surgical intervention.
