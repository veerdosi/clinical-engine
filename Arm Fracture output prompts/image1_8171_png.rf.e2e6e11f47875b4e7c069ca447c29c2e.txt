The X-ray image displays a proximal humerus with an inserted plate and screws, indicative of surgical intervention, likely following a fracture. The surrounding soft tissue appears to have normal radiographic density, with no signs of acute inflammation or fluid collections evident in the periarticular regions. There is no visible displacement of the humeral head, suggesting proper alignment postoperatively.
