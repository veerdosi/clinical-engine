The X-ray image provided displays the left humerus in a lateral view. Notable observations include the presence of cortical irregularities, which may suggest underlying osteolytic lesions or potential degenerative changes within the diaphysis. Additionally, there appears to be a displacement of the humeral head, indicative of a possible glenohumeral joint dislocation or associated soft tissue injury.
