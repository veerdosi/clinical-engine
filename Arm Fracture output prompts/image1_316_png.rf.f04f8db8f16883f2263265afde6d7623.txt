The X-ray reveals an anteroposterior view of the right shoulder joint, displaying both the humeral head and glenoid fossa. There appears to be a notable joint space narrowing, suggestive of potential osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint. Additionally, there are signs of subacromial calcific tendinopathy, characterized by calcific deposits near the supraspinatus tendon, which may contribute to impingement symptoms.
