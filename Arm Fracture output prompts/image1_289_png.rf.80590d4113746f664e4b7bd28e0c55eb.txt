The X-ray image presented shows a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing a prominent presence of osteophytes at the olecranon and medial epicondyle, indicative of osteoarthritis. There is a noticeable joint space narrowing between the distal humerus and proximal ulna, suggestive of degenerative changes associated with chronic articular cartilage wear. Additionally, the presence of subchondral sclerosis is observed, further supporting the diagnosis of osteoarthritic changes in the elbow joint.
