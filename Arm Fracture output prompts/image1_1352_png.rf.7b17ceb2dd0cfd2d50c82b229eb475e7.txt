The X-ray image depicts the left shoulder, showing an anomalous metallic fixation device suggesting a previous surgical intervention, likely for a fracture or instability in the proximal humerus. Evidence of osseous remodeling can be observed surrounding the hardware, indicating a healing process possibly related to a prior trauma or orthopedic procedure. The alignment of the humeral head appears slightly altered, which may reflect a deformity or malalignment resulting from the initial injury or the fixation method used.
