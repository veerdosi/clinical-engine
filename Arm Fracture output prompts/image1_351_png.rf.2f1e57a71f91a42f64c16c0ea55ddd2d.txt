The X-ray image demonstrates the right forearm in an oblique view, revealing both the radius and ulna. There is a notable angulation present in the mid-shaft of the radius, suggestive of a potential fracture or deformity. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears compromised, indicating possible displacement or angulation that may warrant further evaluation and clinical correlation.
