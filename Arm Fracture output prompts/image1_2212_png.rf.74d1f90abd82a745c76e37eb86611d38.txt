The X-ray image displays the left elbow joint, which appears to exhibit overlapping skeletal structures. Notably, there is an abnormal alignment of the ulna and radius, indicative of possible osteoarthritic changes or joint instability. Additionally, slight erosions or age-related degenerative changes may be observed in the joint surfaces, requiring further clinical correlation for a definitive diagnosis.
