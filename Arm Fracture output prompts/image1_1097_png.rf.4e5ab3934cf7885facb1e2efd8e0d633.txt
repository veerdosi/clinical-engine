The image depicts a right wrist X-ray, showing the carpal bones and the distal radius and ulna. Notably, there is an irregularity in the anatomical alignment of the bones, which may suggest the presence of a fracture or malunion. Additionally, there appears to be joint space narrowing in the carpal region, potentially indicating degenerative changes or arthritis.
