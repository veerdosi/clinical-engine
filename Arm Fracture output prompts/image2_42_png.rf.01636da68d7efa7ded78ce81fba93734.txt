The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the forearm, showing both the radius and ulna prominently. There is evidence of a possible distal radius fracture, characterized by cortex disruption and associated soft tissue swelling. Additionally, the alignment of the bone appears to be compromised, indicating a potential malunion or angulation of the fracture.
