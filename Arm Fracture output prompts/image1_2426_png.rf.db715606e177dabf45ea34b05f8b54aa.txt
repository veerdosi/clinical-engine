The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left forearm, specifically highlighting the distal radius and the proximal ulna. Notable is the presence of an intramedullary pin, indicative of previous surgical intervention, likely related to fracture stabilization. The alignment of the bones appears to be within normal limits, with no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation observed adjacent to the fixation device.
