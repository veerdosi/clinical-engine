The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormality in the elbow joint region of the left arm, highlighting potential pathological changes in the osseous structures. Notable findings include possible joint effusion and soft tissue swelling surrounding the olecranon process, which may suggest inflammatory conditions such as olecranon bursitis or synovitis. Additionally, the alignment of the humeroulnar joint appears compromised, indicating possible joint instability or malalignment that may be associated with acute or chronic injury.
