The X-ray depicts an anteroposterior view of the left forearm, revealing the radius and ulna. Notably, there is a midshaft fracture of the ulna characterized by a complete disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is evidence of a greenstick fracture involving the radius, which is indicative of bending without complete cortical disruption, commonly observed in pediatric patients.
