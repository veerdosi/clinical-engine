The X-ray image depicts the bones of the hand, specifically highlighting the phalangeal structures of the fingers. Notable is the presence of a fracture in one of the distal phalanx bones, characterized by a break in continuity and displacement at the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling around the affected area, which could suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma-related edema.
