The X-ray image presented displays a right forearm, including the radius and ulna, in an extended position. There is notable evidence of a fracture, potentially indicating an acute injury, with displacement observed at the midshaft of the radius. Additionally, there are soft tissue changes suggestive of surrounding edema, which may further indicate an inflammatory response to the fracture.
