The X-ray demonstrates a lateral view of the shoulder joint, with clear visualization of the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and surrounding bony structures. Notably, there is evidence of subacromial space narrowing, which may indicate potential impingement or associated rotator cuff pathology. Additionally, minor degenerative changes, such as osteophyte formation, are observed along the acromion and distal clavicle, suggesting possible osteoarthritis in the acromioclavicular joint.
