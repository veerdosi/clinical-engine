The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left humerus and forearm, revealing the anatomical alignment of the bone structures. There is evidence of a possible angulation deformity of the ulna, characterized by a notable curvature that may indicate underlying pathology such as a malunion or deformity. Additionally, the joint spaces appear preserved with no significant signs of osteoarthritis or effusion noted within the elbow articulation.
