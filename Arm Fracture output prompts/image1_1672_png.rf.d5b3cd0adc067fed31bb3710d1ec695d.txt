The X-ray image shows an adult human forearm with evidence of an ulnar and radial fracture, meticulously aligned with an external fixation device. The external fixator is observed placed along the length of the forearm, indicating stabilization of the fracture fragments. The surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of swelling or edema, typical in cases of acute fractures but not specifically detailed in this image.
