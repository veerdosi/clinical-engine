The X-ray displays both the right and left wrists, showing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalangeal bones clearly. Notable to the examination is a malalignment of the distal radial and ulnar joints on one wrist, indicating potential wrist instability or a previous fracture. Additionally, there may be evidence of osseous changes consistent with osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing or subchondral sclerosis, particularly in the carpal region.
