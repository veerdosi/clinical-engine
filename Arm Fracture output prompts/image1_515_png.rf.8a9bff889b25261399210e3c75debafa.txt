The X-ray image of the right hand reveals an apparent fracture at the distal phalanx of the middle finger, characterized by cortical disruption and a visible fracture line. Notably, there is a non-displaced fracture fragment located at the base of the distal phalanx, which may indicate soft tissue swelling or hematoma associated with the injury. The alignment of the metacarpals and proximal phalanges appears intact; however, the possible underlying complications such as joint involvement or ligamentous injury should be assessed further.
