The X-ray of the right hand displays a pronounced, acute angulation at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, suggesting the presence of a possible fracture. The soft tissue surrounding the digital phalanges appears swollen, which may indicate associated edema or hematoma formation. Additionally, there is an evident misalignment of at least one of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, raising concern for potential ligamentous injury or instability.
