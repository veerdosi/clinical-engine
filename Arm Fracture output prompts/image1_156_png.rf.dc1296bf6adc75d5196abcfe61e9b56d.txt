The X-ray image presents a lateral view of the left hand, with particular emphasis on the phalanges of the fifth digit. Notable findings include a deformity of the distal phalanx, characterized by a dorsal angulation and a possible fracture line indicative of an underlying bony abnormality. Additionally, there appears to be mild soft tissue swelling surrounding the affected area, suggesting possible trauma or inflammation related to the observed abnormalities.
