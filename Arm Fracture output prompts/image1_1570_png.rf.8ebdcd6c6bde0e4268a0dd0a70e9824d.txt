The X-ray image depicts the left hand, specifically highlighting the phalangeal bones. Notably, there are two metallic fixation devices, likely surgical pins, positioned within the distal phalanx of the index finger, indicative of prior surgical intervention, possibly to treat a fracture. The surrounding bone structures appear intact, though there may be signs of previous trauma or deformity related to the fixation devices.
