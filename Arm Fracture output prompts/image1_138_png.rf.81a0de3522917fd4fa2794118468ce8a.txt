The x-ray image displays the bony architecture of the right hand, particularly the phalanges and metacarpals. There is a notable joint swelling and distortion at the proximal interphalangeal joints, suggesting potential inflammatory changes consistent with conditions such as arthritis. Additionally, there are signs of bone resorption around the joint surfaces, which may indicate underlying disease processes affecting the integrity of the periarticular bones.
