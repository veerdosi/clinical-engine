The X-ray displays an anteroposterior view of the left forearm, specifically the distal humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is a fracture observed in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by a transverse line and potential displacement. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which may indicate an associated contusion or hematoma.
