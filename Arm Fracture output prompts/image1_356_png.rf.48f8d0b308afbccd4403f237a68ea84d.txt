The X-ray image depicts the right forearm in anteroposterior view, clearly demonstrating the radius and ulna. There is a notable angulation and potential fracture line in the midshaft region of the radius, suggesting an acute injury. Additionally, soft tissue swelling is evident surrounding the radiocarpal joint, which may indicate associated edema or hematoma formation.
