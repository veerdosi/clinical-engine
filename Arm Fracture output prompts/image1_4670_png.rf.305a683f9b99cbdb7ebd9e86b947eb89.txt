The X-ray image demonstrates a complex fracture of the distal femur with associated hardware in place, indicative of surgical intervention. Notable is the presence of a locking plate and screws, which suggest stabilization of the fracture site. There is a visible callus formation surrounding the fracture, indicating the healing process, but the alignment of the bone fragments appears compromised, potentially indicating malalignment or nonunion.
