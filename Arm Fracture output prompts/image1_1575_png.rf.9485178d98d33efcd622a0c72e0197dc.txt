The X-ray image demonstrates a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a transverse break in the cortical bone. Notably, there is an intramedullary nail present within the radius, indicating surgical intervention, likely for stabilization of the fracture. The alignment of the carpal bones appears intact, with no signs of significant displacement or angulation at the fracture site.
