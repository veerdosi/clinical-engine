The X-ray film depicts three views of the wrist and forearm, revealing a significant fracture of the distal radius with associated dorsal angulation. The ulna appears intact, but there is pronounced soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, suggesting possible soft tissue injury or hematoma formation. In the central image, there is evidence of joint effusion within the radiocarpal joint, indicating possible inflammatory or traumatic conditions affecting the surrounding structures.
