The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the knee joint, showcasing the femur, tibia, and patella. There is notable joint space narrowing, indicative of potential osteoarthritis, characterized by the degeneration of cartilage within the joint. Additionally, osteophyte formation may be observed at the margins of the femoral condyles, further suggesting bone remodeling associated with chronic degenerative changes.
