The image depicts a right wrist radiograph, showcasing both the distal radius and ulna. A fracture is noted in the distal radius, characterized by misalignment and potential displacement typical of a Colles' fracture, commonly occurring at the wrist due to fall-related trauma. The radiographic findings also indicate soft tissue swelling around the joint, suggesting an acute injury.
