The X-ray image depicts the right wrist and hand, showing the distal radius and ulna. There appears to be a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a jagged line through the cortical bone, indicating a potential fracture displacement. Additionally, soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint may suggest an associated contusion or hematoma due to traumatic injury.
