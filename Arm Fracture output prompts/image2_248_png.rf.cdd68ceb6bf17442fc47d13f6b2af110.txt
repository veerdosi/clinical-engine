The X-ray image appears to show a right knee joint with notable changes suggestive of degenerative joint disease, characterized by joint space narrowing and potential osteophyte formation along the articular surfaces. The presence of subchondral sclerosis may indicate chronic stress on the bone beneath the cartilage, often associated with osteoarthritis. Additionally, any irregularities or variations in the contour of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau may further support a diagnosis of underlying joint pathology.
