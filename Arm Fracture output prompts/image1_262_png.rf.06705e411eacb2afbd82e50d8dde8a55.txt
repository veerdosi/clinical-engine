The radiograph presents an anteroposterior view of the left knee joint, demonstrating significant osteophyte formation around the femoral condyles and the patella, indicative of osteoarthritis. Joint space narrowing is observed, particularly in the medial compartment, suggesting degenerative changes. Additionally, there is subchondral sclerosis evident at the tibial plateau, consistent with chronic arthritic changes.
