The X-ray reveals a clear image of the forearm, comprising both the radius and the ulna, demonstrating a significant angulation deformity. Notably, there is a complete fracture of the radius with proximal displacement, indicative of a possible radius head fracture. The ulna appears intact; however, there may be accompanying soft tissue swelling and potential hematoma formation surrounding the fracture site.
