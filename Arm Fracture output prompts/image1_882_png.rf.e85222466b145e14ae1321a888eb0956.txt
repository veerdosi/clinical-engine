The image presents a lateral view of the left knee joint, illustrating the femur, tibia, and patella. There is notable joint effusion, indicated by a radiolucent area around the knee, suggesting a potential inflammatory or traumatic process. Additionally, there is evidence of osteophyte formation around the patellar region, which could be indicative of osteoarthritis or prior mechanical stress to the joint.
