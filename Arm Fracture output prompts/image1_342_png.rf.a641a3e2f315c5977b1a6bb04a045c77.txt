The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, focusing on the elbow joint and the distal humerus. There is an observable joint effusion, evidenced by soft tissue swelling around the olecranon region, which may suggest underlying inflammatory or traumatic processes. Additionally, the appearance of the radial head shows signs of possible avascular necrosis or changes consistent with joint degeneration, warranting further investigation.
