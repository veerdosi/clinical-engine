The X-ray demonstrates an oblique fracture of the left radius, visible in the distal forearm region, with evident displacement. Aninternal fixation device, likely a plate or external stabilizing hardware, is evident along the fracture line, indicating prior surgical intervention. Soft tissue swelling may be noted adjacent to the fracture site, suggesting a potential inflammatory response or hematoma formation associated with the injury.
