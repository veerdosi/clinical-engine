The X-ray image displays the forearm, including the radius and ulna, with notable radiolucent lines indicating potential fractures. There is evidence of cortical disruption at the midshaft of the radius, which is suggestive of an acute fracture. Additionally, the alignment of the bones appears to be compromised, indicating possible displacement or angulation associated with the fracture.
