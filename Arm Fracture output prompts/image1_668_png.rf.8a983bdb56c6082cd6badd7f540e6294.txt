The X-ray image presents the right elbow joint, demonstrating the osseous structures comprising the humerus, radius, and ulna. A notable feature observed is the presence of joint effusion, indicated by an abnormal soft tissue density surrounding the joint space. Additionally, there are signs of osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint, suggesting possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
