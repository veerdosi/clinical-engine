The X-ray image reveals a prominent deformity in the distal femur characterized by an angulated, malaligned appearance suggestive of a fracture. There is a noticeable callus formation which indicates a healing process, often associated with a recent fracture. Additionally, the cortex appears irregular, indicating possible underlying pathology such as osteopenia or stress-related changes.
