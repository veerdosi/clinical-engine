The X-ray image depicts the distal phalanx of the little finger (fifth digit) with a notable angulation at the distal interphalangeal joint. There is evidence of possible bony malalignment, which may suggest a fracture or dislocation of the distal phalanx. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the joint appears to be swollen, indicating a potential inflammatory response or hematoma formation related to the underlying injury.
