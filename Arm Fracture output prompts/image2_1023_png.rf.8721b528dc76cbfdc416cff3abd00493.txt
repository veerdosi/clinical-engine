The image depicts a left forearm X-ray, showing the anatomy of the radius and ulna. There is evidence of an incomplete fracture located in the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortical bone but without significant displacement. Additionally, the carpal and metacarpal bones appear normal, with no indications of associated soft tissue injuries or edema present in the evaluated regions.
