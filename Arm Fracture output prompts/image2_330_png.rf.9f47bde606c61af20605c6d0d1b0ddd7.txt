The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left elbow, revealing the presence of metallic fixation devices, indicative of a surgical intervention such as internal fixation following a fracture. There is evidence of callus formation around the fixation site, suggesting a healing process in progress. The overall alignment of the humerus, radius, and ulna appears disrupted, indicative of a post-traumatic deformity or malunion.
