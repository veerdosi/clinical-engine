The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the right shoulder, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and proximal humerus. Notable is a possible dislocation or subluxation of the shoulder joint, indicated by the abnormal positioning of the humeral head relative to the glenoid cavity. Additionally, there is evidence of potential osteophyte formation along the joint margins, suggestive of degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis.
