The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the elbow joint, revealing significant consolidation of a fracture in the lower humerus near the elbow joint. Notably, there is evidence of malalignment at the fracture site, which may suggest a potential misalignment or unstable fracture configuration. The surrounding soft tissues appear to be intact, with no significant signs of effusion or associated bony lesions noted in this view.
