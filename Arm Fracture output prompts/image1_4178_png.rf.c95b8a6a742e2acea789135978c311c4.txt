The radiograph displays a lateral view of the hand, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpal bones. There is a notable presence of soft tissue swelling around the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, which may suggest infection or traumatic injury. Additionally, the alignment of the proximal phalanx exhibits angulation, raising the suspicion of a possible fracture or dislocation involving the fifth digit.
