The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing clear visualization of the humerus, radius, and ulna. There is an apparent fracture line noted in the distal radius, characterized by angulation and potential displacement, indicating a possible distal radius fracture. Surrounding soft tissues may display signs of edema, and there are no evident joint effusions within the elbow joint region.
