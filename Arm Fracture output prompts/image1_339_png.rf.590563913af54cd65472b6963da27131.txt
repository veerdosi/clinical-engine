The X-ray image displays the right shoulder joint, including the humeral head, glenoid cavity, and proximal humerus. There is an observable lack of smooth contour at the humeral head, which may suggest the presence of osteoarthritis or a previous rotator cuff injury characterized by associated changes in bone density or morphology. Additionally, the acromion appears to have irregularities, potentially indicating impingement syndrome or a type of acromial morphology that can predispose to shoulder impingement.
