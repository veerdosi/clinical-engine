The radiograph displays the right forearm in a posteroanterior (PA) view, encompassing both the radius and ulna bones. Notable is the presence of a possible diaphyseal fracture in the midshaft of the radius, characterized by cortical disruption and a displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, there is an observable angulation at the fracture site, suggesting a significant rotational deformity that may impact the alignment of the forearm.
