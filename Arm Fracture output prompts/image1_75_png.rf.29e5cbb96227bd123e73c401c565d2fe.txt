The X-ray images presented illustrate three views of the left forearm, including the distal radius and ulna. There is a discernible fracture in the mid-shaft of the radius with accompanying cortical disruption, indicating a potential acute traumatic injury. Additionally, the alignment of both the radius and ulna appears compromised, suggesting possible associated soft tissue injury or instability in the forearm structure. 

In the hand view, the carpals and phalanges demonstrate normal alignment, with no visible signs of dislocation or osteoarthritic changes. The joint spaces appear preserved, indicating a lack of degenerative changes within the articulations. These images may warrant further evaluation for potential surgical intervention, depending on the degree of displacement of the fracture.
