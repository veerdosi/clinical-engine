The x-ray image depicts the forearm, specifically focusing on the radius and ulna. There is a notable oligoarthritis of the wrist joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the distal radius. Additionally, there is evidence of a potential distal radial fracture, indicated by a fracture line and displacement in the cortex of the radius, suggesting instability and potential impairment of wrist function.
