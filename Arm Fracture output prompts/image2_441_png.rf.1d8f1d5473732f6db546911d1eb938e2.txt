The provided image is an X-ray of the forearm, specifically showing the radius and ulna. There is a notable presence of a transverse fracture in the radius, characterized by an abrupt interruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is a mild posterior angulation at the fracture site, which is indicative of a potential instability in the alignment of the forearm bones.
