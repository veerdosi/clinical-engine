The X-ray image shows the left shoulder joint, with a clear view of the humeral head and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. There is evidence of a potential glenohumeral joint effusion, indicated by the radiolucent area surrounding the joint space, which may suggest inflammation or possible injury. Additionally, there appears to be slight irregularity of the proximal humerus, which can be associated with conditions such as rotator cuff pathology or degenerative changes.
