The image displays an X-ray of the right forearm, revealing a callus formation indicative of prior fracture healing. There is a noticeable angulation of the radius and ulna, suggestive of a deformity present in the alignment of the bones. Additionally, there is evidence of periosteal reaction along the diaphysis, which may indicate underlying pathology or stress on the bone structures.
