The X-ray image demonstrates an acute angular deformity in the distal humerus, characterized by a pronounced valgus deformity. The radiographic representation reveals cortical disruption, suggestive of a possible fracture or stress fracture, along with surrounding soft tissue edema. Signs of joint effusion at the elbow joint may indicate associated intra-articular injury or ligamentous compromise in conjunction with the noted deformity.
