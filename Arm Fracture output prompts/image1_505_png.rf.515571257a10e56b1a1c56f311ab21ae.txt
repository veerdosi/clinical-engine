The X-ray image displays a right hand in a posterior-anterior view, primarily focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is a transverse fracture located in the proximal phalanx of the second digit, characterized by a disruption of the cortical bone continuity. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may suggest an underlying inflammatory response.
