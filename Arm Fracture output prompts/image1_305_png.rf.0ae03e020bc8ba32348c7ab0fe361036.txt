The X-ray image of the wrist shows the distal radius and ulna, along with the carpal bones and metacarpals. There is evidence of possible fractures in the distal radius, characterized by periosteal reaction and a disrupted trabecular pattern, which may indicate trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the carpal bones appears irregular, suggestive of potential ligamentous injury or dislocation.
