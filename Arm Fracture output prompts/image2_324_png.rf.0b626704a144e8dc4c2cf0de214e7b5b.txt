The X-ray image reveals a transverse fracture of the mid-shaft of the ulna, characterized by a clear disruption in cortical continuity. Additionally, there is evidence of an associated radial fracture, which indicates a potential for instability in the forearm structure. There are no signs of significant displacement or angulation observed in the fractured segments, suggesting a non-complex injury.
