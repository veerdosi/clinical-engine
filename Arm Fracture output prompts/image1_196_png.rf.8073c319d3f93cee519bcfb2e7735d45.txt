The X-ray image presents a left arm with notable abnormalities in the distal humerus and proximal radius. There is evidence of increased radiolucency indicative of potential osteolytic lesions, which may suggest underlying pathology such as benign or malignant neoplasms. Additionally, the alignment of the ulnar and radial bones appears abnormal, raising suspicion for possible fracture or displacement associated with trauma.
