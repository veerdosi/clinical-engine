The X-ray image demonstrates an abnormal morphology of the left knee joint, indicating potential underlying pathology. Notably, there is osseous enlargement in the area of the distal femur, suggestive of possible osteophyte formation or intra-articular degenerative changes. Additionally, joint space narrowing is observed, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or a form of inflammatory arthropathy affecting the knee.
