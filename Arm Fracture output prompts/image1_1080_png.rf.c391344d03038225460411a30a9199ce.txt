The X-ray image displays the distal radius and ulnar bones of the forearm, revealing potential signs of a distal radius fracture, commonly observed in falls. There may be evidence of an associated fracture, as indicated by irregularities in the cortical outline and potential displacement of fragments. Soft tissue swelling can be noted adjacent to the fracture site, which may suggest inflammatory or hematoma changes consistent with acute injury.
