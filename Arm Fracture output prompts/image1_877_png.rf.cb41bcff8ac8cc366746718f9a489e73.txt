The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the humerus, forearm, and elbow joint, showing significant alignment issues. There is an observable fracture across the mid-shaft of the humerus, with evidence of cortical disruption and potential displacement. Additionally, an intramedullary nail is noted in situ, suggesting a surgical intervention for stabilization of the fracture.
