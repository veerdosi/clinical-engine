The X-ray image demonstrates a significant angulation along the right femur, suggestive of a possible deformity such as a valgus or varus deformity. There appears to be a radiolucent line across the diaphysis, indicating a potential fracture or non-union. The joint spaces around the knee exhibit slight irregularities, which may suggest underlying pathology such as osteoarthritis or joint effusion.
