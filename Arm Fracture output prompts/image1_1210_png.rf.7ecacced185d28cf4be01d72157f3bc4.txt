The X-ray image presents a view of the left shoulder joint, demonstrating a potential fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. There is a notable displacement of the humeral head, which may signify periarticular involvement and compromise the integrity of the glenohumeral articulation. Additionally, the surrounding soft tissues appear to be prominent, raising suspicion for possible traumatic effusion or hematoma formation.
