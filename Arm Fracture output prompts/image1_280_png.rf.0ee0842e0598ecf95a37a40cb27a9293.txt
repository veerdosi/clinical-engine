The X-ray image displays the skeletal structure of a human hand, clearly illustrating the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals. Notably, there appears to be an unusual angulation of one or more digits, suggesting the presence of a potential deformity such as a malalignment or displacement. Additionally, the overall joint spaces are well-defined, and no clear signs of acute fractures or osteolytic lesions are observed at this resolution.
