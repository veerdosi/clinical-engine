The X-ray image reveals an acute fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus, with surgical hardware evident, indicating a prior fixation procedure. There is notable alignment with the presence of plates and screws, suggesting stabilization of the fracture site. Surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, although this is not directly visible in the image.
