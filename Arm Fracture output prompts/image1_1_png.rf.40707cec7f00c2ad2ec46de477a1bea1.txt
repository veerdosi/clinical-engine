The X-ray demonstrates a right shoulder joint with evidence of a possible glenohumeral joint effusion, indicated by the reduced joint space and soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint. There is noted cortical disruption and irregularity of the humeral head, suggestive of osteolytic lesions that may be associated with underlying pathology such as osteomyelitis or malignancy. Additionally, the acromion exhibits broadening and possible alterations in contour, indicative of degenerative changes or rotator cuff pathology.
