The image depicts an anteroposterior X-ray view of the left distal femur, revealing the presence of a metallic locking plate and screws, indicative of internal fixation for a fracture. There is noticeable cortical disruption at the fracture site, suggesting a previous traumatic injury, with signs of callus formation around the periosteum, which is consistent with the healing process. The alignment of the femur appears satisfactory; however, any additional features of non-union or malunion would require further evaluation to assess the stability of the fixation.
