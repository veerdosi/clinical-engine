The X-ray image displays the left forearm, specifically highlighting the radius and ulna, which appear to be intact with no overt fractures or dislocations. There is no evidence of osteolytic lesions, cortical irregularities, or signs of inflammatory processes in the surrounding soft tissue. The joint spaces, particularly at the wrist and elbow, maintain a normal alignment and appear unremarkable, suggesting a stable anatomical structure without degenerative changes.
