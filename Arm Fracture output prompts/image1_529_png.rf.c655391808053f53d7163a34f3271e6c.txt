The X-ray images depict the left wrist in both anteroposterior and lateral views. There is evident joint effusion in the radiocarpal joint, characterized by increased density suggesting potential inflammatory arthritis or post-traumatic changes. Additionally, there is a notable alteration in bone density around the distal radius and ulna, possibly indicating osteopenia or the presence of an underlying systemic disease.

The observed alignment of the carpal bones suggests possible scaphoid involvement, which could be indicative of fracture or non-union. Various phalanx angulations are evident, hinting at possible malalignment or prior injury. The overall radiographic appearance warrants further evaluation for differential diagnoses, including tenosynovitis or ligamentous injury associated with the wrist joint.
