The X-ray reveals a prominent ulna and radius, with clear visualization of the carpal bones and metacarpals extending into the proximal phalanx of the digits. Notably, there appears to be an angulation at the distal radius consistent with a possible fracture or deformity. In addition, soft tissue swelling may be observed surrounding the wrist joint, suggesting the presence of edema or inflammatory changes that could correlate with trauma or underlying pathology.
