The X-ray image demonstrates a lateral view of the left hand, prominently showcasing the phalanges of the fingers. There is evidence of a fracture depicted in the proximal phalanx of the middle finger, characterized by a disruption in cortical continuity and periosteal reaction. Additional findings may include potential soft tissue edema surrounding the fracture site, which is indicative of an acute injury.
