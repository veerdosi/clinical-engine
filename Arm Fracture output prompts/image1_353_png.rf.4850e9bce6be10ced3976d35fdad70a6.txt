The X-ray image reveals an abnormal curvature of the proximal phalanx of the affected digit, suggestive of a possible metacarpal or phalangeal deformity. There are noted joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the distal interphalangeal joint, indicating potential osteoarthritic changes. Soft tissue swelling is present around the periarticular area, which may be indicative of inflammation or soft tissue injury.
