The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the left forearm, highlighting the ulna and radius. There is notable cortical disruption observed in the mid-shaft region of the ulna, suggesting a fracture, while the radius appears intact. Joint alignment at the elbow and wrist shows no significant displacement, although the presence of soft tissue swelling may be inferred.
