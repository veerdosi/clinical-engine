The X-ray image depicts a clear fracture of the diaphysis of the radius, characterized by a disrupted cortex and a visible fracture line extending transversely across the bone. Surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, although this is not directly assessable from the X-ray itself. The alignment of the fractured segments suggests potential displacement, which could warrant further evaluation for surgical intervention.
