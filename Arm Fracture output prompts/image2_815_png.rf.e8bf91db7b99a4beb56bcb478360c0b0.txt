The X-ray image displays an incomplete fracture of the distal radius, characterized by an interruption in the cortical bone continuity, suggesting a possible buckle or torus fracture pattern. There is notable displacement at the fracture site, which may indicate instability in the anatomical alignment of the radius. Additionally, the presence of soft tissue swelling is evident adjacent to the fracture, which may denote associated contusions or hematoma formation in the surrounding soft tissue structures.
