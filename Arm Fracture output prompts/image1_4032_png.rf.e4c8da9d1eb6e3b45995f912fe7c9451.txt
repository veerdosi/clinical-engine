The X-ray image depicts the bony structures of a human hand, specifically focusing on the phalanges and metacarpals. There is an abnormality visible in the second digit, characterized by a misalignment and abnormal angulation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may indicate a possible fracture or dislocation. Additionally, there are signs of joint space narrowing around the affected area, suggesting potential degenerative changes or an inflammatory process affecting the joint structures.
