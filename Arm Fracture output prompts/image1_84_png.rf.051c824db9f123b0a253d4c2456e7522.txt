The radiograph depicts a lateral view of the distal humerus, forearm, and wrist, demonstrating normal anatomical alignment. The image reveals an apparent fracture of the distal radius characterized by a cortical break and potential volar angulation, indicative of an acute injury. Additionally, signs of soft tissue swelling are noted around the fracture site, which may suggest associated hematoma formation.
