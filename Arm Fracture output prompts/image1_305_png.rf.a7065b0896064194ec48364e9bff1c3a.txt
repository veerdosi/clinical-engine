The X-ray image depicts an oblique fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a break in the cortical bone visible on the radial side. There is also evident soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which suggests the presence of associated hematoma or inflammation. Additionally, there is concern for potential intra-articular involvement at the wrist joint due to misalignment of the carpal bones.
