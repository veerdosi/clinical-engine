The X-ray image displays the left shoulder joint, clearly showing the humeral head and the surrounding anatomical structures. There is a notable deformity characterized by an abnormal alignment or positioning of the humeral head within the glenoid cavity, which may suggest the presence of a dislocation or subluxation. Additionally, the articular surface of the glenoid cavity appears irregular, indicating potential degenerative changes or underlying pathology such as osteoarthritis.
