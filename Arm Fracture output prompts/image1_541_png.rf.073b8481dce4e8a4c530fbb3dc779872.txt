The image depicts a right humerus in an anteroposterior view, clearly showing the cortical margins and trabecular patterns. Notably, there is an observable area of cortical disruption, suggestive of a possible fracture or osteolytic lesion affecting the integrity of the bone. Additionally, the elbow joint demonstrates normal articulation, with no apparent effusion or bony abnormalities present in this view.
