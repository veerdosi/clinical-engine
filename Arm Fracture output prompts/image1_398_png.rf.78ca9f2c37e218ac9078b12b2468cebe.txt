The X-ray images exhibit a right elbow joint with the presence of an internal fixation device, likely indicative of prior surgical intervention for an olecranon or distal humeral fracture. Notably, there is evidence of callus formation at the fracture site, suggesting active bone healing. Additionally, there may be joint effusion observed, which could indicate underlying inflammatory processes or trauma at the elbow joint.
