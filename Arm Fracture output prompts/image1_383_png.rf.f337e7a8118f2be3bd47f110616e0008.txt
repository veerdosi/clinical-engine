The X-ray image displays the lateral view of an elbow joint, showing significant radiopaque areas in the vicinity of the humerus and proximal radius, suggesting possible osteochondroma formation. There is also notable angulation of the forearm bones, which may indicate a pathological deformity, possibly resulting in valgus or varus malalignment of the elbow. Additionally, a lack of typical joint space width is observed, which could be indicative of underlying joint pathology, such as osteoarthritis or inflammatory joint disease.
