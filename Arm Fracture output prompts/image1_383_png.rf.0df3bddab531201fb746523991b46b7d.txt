The image depicts an anteroposterior (AP) X-ray of the forearm, showing the radial and ulnar bones. There is the presence of an intramedullary nail or fixation plate along the shaft of one of the long bones, indicating prior surgical intervention, likely for a fracture stabilization. Additionally, there are signs of callus formation around the fracture site, suggesting a healing process post-injury.
