The X-ray image demonstrates the left upper extremity, including the scapula, humerus, and proximal radius and ulna. Notable findings include potential signs of humeral head deformity and joint space narrowing at the glenohumeral joint, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis or rotator cuff pathology. The surrounding soft tissue appears unremarkable without evidence of acute trauma or significant swelling.
