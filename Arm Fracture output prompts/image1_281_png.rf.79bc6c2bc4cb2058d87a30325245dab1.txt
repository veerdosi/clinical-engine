The X-ray images depict an oblique fracture of the distal radius in the left wrist, characterized by a visible disruption of the cortical bone continuity. There is associated dorsal angulation of the distal fragment, which is consistent with a Colles' fracture, commonly seen in wrist injuries. Additionally, soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site may indicate an acute inflammatory response, further emphasizing the need for assessment of potential vascular or neurovascular compromise in the area.
