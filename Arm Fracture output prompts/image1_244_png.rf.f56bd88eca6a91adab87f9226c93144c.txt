The X-ray of the left hand shows a lateral view of the phalanges with an apparent fracture in the distal phalanx of the index finger. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the injured area, indicating a possible acute injury. Additionally, the alignment of the distal interphalangeal joint appears abnormal, suggesting a potential dislocation or misalignment of the joint structures.
