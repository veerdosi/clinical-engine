The X-ray image shows the skeletal structure of the left hand, focusing on the phalanges of the middle finger. Notable is the presence of a possible fracture or malalignment in one of the proximal phalanges, as indicated by increased radiolucency suggesting an area of potential trauma. Additionally, the joint spaces appear intact, with no visible signs of arthritic changes or acute bony lesions in the surrounding areas.
