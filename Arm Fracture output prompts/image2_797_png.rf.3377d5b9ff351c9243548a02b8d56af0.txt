The X-ray image displays the left forearm, including the radius and ulna bones. Notably, there is evidence of a non-displaced fracture at the mid-shaft of the radius, characterized by a break in the cortex without significant misalignment of the bone fragments. The surrounding soft tissues appear intact, with no signs of edema or periosteal reaction visible on the film.
