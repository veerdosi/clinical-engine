The X-ray image depicts an oblique view of the left hand and wrist, revealing the carpal bones, metacarpals, and proximal phalanges. There is evidence of potential bony deformity or misalignment in the structures of the proximal phalanx, which may indicate a malunion or nonunion status. Additionally, the presence of soft tissue swelling may suggest an underlying inflammatory process or trauma affecting the wrist and hand region, necessitating further clinical correlation.
