The X-ray image depicts the left wrist with a clear view of the carpal and metacarpal bones. Notably, there appears to be a fracture of the distal radius, characterized by a transverse alignment disruptiveness. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, which may suggest an associated acute contusion or hematoma.
