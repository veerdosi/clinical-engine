The X-ray image reveals a notable distal radius fracture with a clear displacement and angulation at the fracture site. Additionally, there is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture, indicative of associated contusions or hematoma formation. The alignment of neighboring carpal bones appears unremarkable; however, careful assessment of the joint surfaces is warranted to rule out any intra-articular involvement.
