The radiograph presents an anteroposterior view of the left knee joint, revealing the femur, tibia, and fibula in alignment. Notably, there is evidence of effusion in the joint space, indicating potential intra-articular pathology such as a meniscal tear or ligamentous injury. Additionally, the presence of irregularities at the knee's articular surfaces could suggest osteochondral damage or effusion contributing to altered joint mechanics.
