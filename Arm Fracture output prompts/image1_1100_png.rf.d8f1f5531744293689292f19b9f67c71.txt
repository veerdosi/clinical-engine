The radiograph depicts a right wrist with several identifiable anatomical structures, including the carpal bones and metacarpals. Notably, there is evidence of a previous fracture involving the distal radius, indicated by callus formation and potential malalignment. Additionally, the presence of orthopedic hardware suggests prior surgical intervention, possibly for fracture stabilization, and raises concern for non-union or post-traumatic changes in the surrounding soft tissue.
