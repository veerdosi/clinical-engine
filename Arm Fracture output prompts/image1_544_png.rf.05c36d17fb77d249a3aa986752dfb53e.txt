Notably, there is a disruption in the normal alignment and contour of the distal radius, suggesting a potential fracture or deformity in this region. Additionally, the soft tissue surrounding the bones may exhibit edema or signs of trauma, warranting further clinical evaluation for possible associated injuries or complications.
