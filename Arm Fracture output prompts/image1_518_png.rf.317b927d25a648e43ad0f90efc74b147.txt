The X-ray depicts the left knee joint, displaying the femur, tibia, and fibula in a lateral view. There is evidence of potential joint effusion, as indicated by increased radiolucency around the joint space, which may suggest inflammation or injury. Furthermore, there is a noticeable irregularity of the medial compartment of the knee, raising suspicion for possible osteoarthritis or degenerative changes, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.
