The X-ray image depicts the left forearm, showing a metallic plate affixed to the distal radius, suggesting prior surgical intervention, likely for fracture stabilization. There is evidence of malalignment of the distal radial segment, and the surrounding soft tissues may demonstrate signs of edema, indicative of trauma. The carpal bones and proximal phalanges appear intact, with no observable signs of acute osseous pathology in the remaining wrist and hand structures.
