The X-ray image reveals a lateral view of the right knee joint, demonstrating the femur, tibia, and fibula in anatomical alignment. There is a notable presence of joint effusion, indicated by a radiolucent area around the patella, which may suggest underlying inflammatory or traumatic processes. Additionally, the cartilage space appears narrowed, potentially indicating degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis or other forms of arthropathy.
