The image presents a lateral radiograph of the right knee joint, demonstrating a prosthetic knee replacement device alongside internal fixation devices indicating previous surgical intervention. Noticeably, there are metallic screws and rods, suggestive of osteosynthetic procedures, likely addressing prior fractures or significant bone instability. The joint space appears compromised, potentially indicative of degenerative changes or post-operative alterations related to the arthroplasty.
