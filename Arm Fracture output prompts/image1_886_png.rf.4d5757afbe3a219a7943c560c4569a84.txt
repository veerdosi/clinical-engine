The X-ray image shows the distal phalanx of the fifth digit, which exhibits an angular deformity suggestive of a possible fracture or malalignment. There is also evidence of soft tissue swelling around the affected area, indicative of inflammatory changes associated with trauma. No signs of avascular necrosis or significant degenerative changes are observed in the adjacent structures.
