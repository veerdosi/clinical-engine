The X-ray image displays a series of radiographs of the left hand, highlighting the phalanges and metacarpals. Notably, there is apparent dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint in the second digit, characterized by the misalignment of the articular surfaces. Additionally, there are signs of potential fracture in the proximal phalanx of the same digit, indicated by a disrupted cortical line and irregularity in bone continuity.
