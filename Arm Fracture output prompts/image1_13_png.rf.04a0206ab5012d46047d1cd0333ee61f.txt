The X-ray image reveals a significant deformity of the distal femur and proximal tibia, suggestive of a complex bone fracture. There is evidence of misalignment at the knee joint, indicating potential malunion or nonunion of the fracture site. Surrounding soft tissue swelling is also noted, which may be indicative of associated hematoma or edema resulting from trauma.
