The X-ray image of the left knee joint demonstrates joint effusion, indicated by an accumulation of fluid in the suprapatellar pouch. The alignment of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau appears incongruent, suggesting a possible meniscal tear or ligamentous injury. Additionally, there is radiographic evidence of subchondral bone edema, which may indicate osteoarthritis or an osteochondral defect.
