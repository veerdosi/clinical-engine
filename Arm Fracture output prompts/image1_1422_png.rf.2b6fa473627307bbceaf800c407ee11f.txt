The X-ray image displays the forearm, revealing significant abnormalities in the radially and ulnarly aligned structures. There is notable misalignment, suggesting the presence of a fracture or possible malunion at the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and irregularities in the bone contour. Additionally, surrounding soft tissue may exhibit signs of edema, which is often indicative of an underlying traumatic event or inflammatory process affecting the area.
