The X-ray image reveals an oblique view of the right shoulder, demonstrating the anatomical structures of the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. Notably, there is a presence of bony irregularity at the greater tuberosity of the humerus, which may suggest a rotator cuff pathology or previous traumatic injury. Additionally, mild acromioclavicular joint degeneration is observed, indicated by joint space narrowing and subacromial cyst formation, consistent with osteoarthritis.
