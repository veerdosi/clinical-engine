The X-ray shows a lateral view of the wrist, highlighting the carpal and metacarpal bones. There is a prominent osseous deformity observed at the base of the first metacarpal, suggestive of a possible Bennett's fracture, characterized by intra-articular involvement. Additionally, there is evidence of possible edema around the scaphoid region, indicating potential soft tissue injury or fracture in that area.
