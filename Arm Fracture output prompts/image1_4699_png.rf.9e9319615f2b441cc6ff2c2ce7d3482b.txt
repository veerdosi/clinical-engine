The X-ray image displays the phalanges of the hand, revealing a potential bone fracture in one of the distal phalanges. There is noticeable pronounced cortical disruption and possible misalignment at the fracture site, indicative of an incomplete or complete fracture pattern. Additionally, soft tissue swelling may be observed around the fracture zone, suggesting accompanying soft tissue injury.
