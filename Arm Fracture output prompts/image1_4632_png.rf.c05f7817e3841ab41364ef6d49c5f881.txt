The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left thumb, showing the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and the proximal phalanx. There is notable angulation at the distal phalanx, suggesting a possible malalignment consistent with a deformity. Additionally, there appears to be soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint, which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process or trauma-related edema.
