The x-ray image displays the proximal humerus along with the glenohumeral joint and the proximal aspect of the scapula. There is evidence of a potential humeral head displacement, which may indicate a shoulder dislocation. Additionally, the presence of subacromial calcification suggests possible rotator cuff pathology or tendinopathy in the region.
