The image presents a lateral X-ray view of the left arm, revealing the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is evidence of an angulated fracture in the distal radius, characterized by cortical disruption and displacement of bone fragments. Additionally, there is soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fracture site, indicating potential hematoma formation and inflammation.
