The X-ray depicts a right humerus with a notable fracture located in the mid-shaft region, characterized by a clear displacement of bone fragments. There is evidence of soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site, which may indicate associated hematoma formation. Additionally, the proximal and distal portions of the humerus appear intact, with no signs of malignant lesions or significant degenerative changes observed in the surrounding joint structures.
