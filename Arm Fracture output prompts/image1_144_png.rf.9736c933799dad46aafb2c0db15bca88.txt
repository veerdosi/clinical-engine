The X-ray image displays the left shoulder region, highlighting the glenohumeral joint and surrounding bony structures. Notable is the presence of osteophyte formation on the inferior aspect of the acromion, indicative of possible degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, there appears to be a narrowing of the subacromial space, which may suggest impingement syndrome affecting the rotator cuff tendons.
