The X-ray image displays a lateral view of the distal radius and ulna, highlighting a fracture in the distal radius, characterized by a misalignment of the bone fragments. The presence of soft tissue swelling is observed, which may indicate an associated hematoma or inflammation. Additionally, there are signs of potential avascular necrosis in the scaphoid bone, which is a concern in fractures around this area.
