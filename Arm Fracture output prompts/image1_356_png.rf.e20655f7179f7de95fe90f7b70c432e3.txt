The X-ray image depicts the skeletal structure of the left wrist and hand, revealing the carpal bones and metacarpal bones clearly. Notable in the image are potential signs of osteoarthritic changes in the first carpometacarpal joint, characterized by joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. There is also evidence of possible soft tissue swelling surrounding the lateral aspect of the wrist, which may indicate an inflammatory response.
