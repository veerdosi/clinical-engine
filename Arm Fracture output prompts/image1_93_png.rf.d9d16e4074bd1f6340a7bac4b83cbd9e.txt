The image displays a lateral view of the left elbow joint, illustrating the humerus, radius, and ulna. Notably, there is an observable joint effusion around the olecranon fossa, which may indicate the presence of inflammatory or degenerative changes in the joint capsule. Furthermore, the radiograph shows signs of potential radial head osteoarthritis, characterized by irregularities in the contour of the radial head and surrounding joint space narrowing.
