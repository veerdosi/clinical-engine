The X-ray image demonstrates a pronounced lucency in the proximal region of the tibia, indicative of a potential stress fracture or localized bone pathology. The cortical outline appears irregular, which may suggest an underlying osteopenic process or a focal lesion. Additionally, there is an absence of bridging callus formation, which may point toward a delayed healing response or non-union concerning in the context of bone integrity.
