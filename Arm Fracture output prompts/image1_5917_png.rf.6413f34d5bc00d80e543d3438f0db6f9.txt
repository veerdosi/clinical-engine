The X-ray image depicts the proximal humerus and the glenohumeral joint, showing slight cortical irregularities indicative of possible osteoarthritis. There is a noted decrease in the joint space, which suggests degenerative changes within the joint structure. Additionally, subtle bone spurs may be observed along the humeral head, consistent with bony lesions often associated with chronic joint inflammation.
