The radiograph depicts a right elbow joint, showing a rounded osseous lesion adjacent to the capitellum, which may suggest osteochondroma or a similar bony growth. The joint space appears intact, but there is notable soft tissue swelling around the region that could indicate inflammation or effusion. Additionally, joint alignment appears maintained, with no evident dislocation or fracture lines in the surrounding bony structures.
