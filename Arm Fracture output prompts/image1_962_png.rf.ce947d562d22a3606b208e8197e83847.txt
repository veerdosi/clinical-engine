The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left hand, showing the skeletal structure of the phalanges and metacarpals. Notable findings include a dorsal angulation of the proximal phalanx in the fourth digit, indicating possible malalignment or deformity. Additionally, signs of joint space narrowing are observed at the metacarpophalangeal joints, which may suggest degenerative changes associated with osteoarthritis.
