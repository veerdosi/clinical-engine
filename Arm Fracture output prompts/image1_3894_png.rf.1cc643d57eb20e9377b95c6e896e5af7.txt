The X-ray depicts a lateral view of the right hand, illustrating the distal phalanges of the fingers and the metacarpals. There is noticeable swelling around the proximal interphalangeal joints, which may suggest inflammation or effusion typically associated with conditions such as arthritis or trauma. Additionally, the alignment of the digits appears to be altered, indicating a potential fracture or dislocation in one or more of the phalangeal bones.
