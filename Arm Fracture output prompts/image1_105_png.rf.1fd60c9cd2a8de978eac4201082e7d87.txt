The X-ray image demonstrates an oblique view of the femur and knee joint, revealing the relationship between the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau. Notably, there is evidence of joint space narrowing, which may indicate the presence of osteoarthritis, characterized by cartilage degradation and subchondral bone changes. Additionally, there may be signs of possible osteophyte formation along the edges of the joint, suggesting degenerative changes that could contribute to pain and functional impairment.
