The X-ray image depicts a lateral view of the left humerus, demonstrating the presence of an intramedullary nail and multiple screws used for stabilization. There is evidence of a mid-shaft humeral fracture, characterized by an irregular cortical contour and fragmentation of osseous tissue at the fracture site. No signs of malalignment are observed, and the metal hardware appears appropriately positioned, indicating surgical intervention for fracture fixation.
