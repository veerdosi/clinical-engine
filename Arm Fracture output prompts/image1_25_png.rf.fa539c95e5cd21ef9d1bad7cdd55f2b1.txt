The X-ray image exhibits the proximal humerus, revealing a potential fracture at the surgical neck, characterized by displacement indicative of a possible proximal humeral fracture. There is notable cortical disruption, along with effusion in the surrounding soft tissue, suggesting the presence of a hematoma. Additionally, the alignment of the glenohumeral joint appears compromised, raising suspicion for associated dislocations or rotator cuff injuries.
