The ultrasound image displays an irregular hypoechoic mass with a heterogeneous internal echogenicity, suggestive of potential malignancy. The presence of posterior acoustic enhancement indicates that the lesion may contain fluid or necrotic tissue. Additionally, surrounding parenchymal changes, such as architectural distortion and possible skin thickening, warrant further clinical evaluation to rule out underlying pathologies, including breast cancer.
