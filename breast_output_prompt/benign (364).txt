The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined anechoic cystic structure within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of a simple breast cyst. Surrounding echogenicity indicates possible surrounding tissue involvement, with no apparent solid components noted within the cyst. Continuing assessment may be warranted to evaluate for any additional irregularities or associated pathologies, such as mastitis or fibrocystic changes.
