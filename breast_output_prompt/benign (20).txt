The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined, hypoechoic mass situated within the breast parenchyma. This lesion exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement, which is characteristic of cystic formations but may also suggest a complex solid-cystic structure. Additional evaluation is warranted to assess for potential pathological features, such as irregular margins or internal vascularity, which could indicate a possible malignancy.
