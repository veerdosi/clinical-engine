The ultrasound image reveals a round, anechoic structure within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of a simple cyst. Surrounding the cyst, there are echogenic areas that may indicate surrounding glandular tissue with normal parenchymal architecture. No solid lesions or irregular borders are observed, which typically helps differentiate simple cysts from potentially complex or malignant masses.
