The ultrasound image displays a complex hypoechoic mass located within the breast parenchyma, which is characterized by irregular borders and heterogeneous echogenicity. There is notable posterior shadowing, potentially indicating the presence of a denser structure or fluid collection associated with this mass. Additionally, surrounding tissue may exhibit signs of edema, raising suspicion for an inflammatory or malignant process.
