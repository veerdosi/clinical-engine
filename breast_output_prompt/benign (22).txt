The ultrasound image demonstrates an anechoic structure with well-defined margins, indicative of a cystic lesion within the breast tissue. The measurements provided suggest a sizeable area characterized by the absence of internal echoes, consistent with a simple breast cyst. Surrounding echogenicity is noted, potentially indicating the presence of adjacent fibroglandular tissue or edema, warranting further evaluation for any associated pathological conditions.
