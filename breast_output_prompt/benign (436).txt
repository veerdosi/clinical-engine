The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, characterized by its irregular margins and orientation. Measurement markers indicate notable dimensions of the lesion, which may suggest the presence of a potentially concerning mass. Surrounding echogenic structures exhibit normal glandular architecture, with no significant lymphadenopathy observed in the adjacent axillary region.
