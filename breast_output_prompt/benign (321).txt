The ultrasound image of the right breast depicts two well-defined, hypoechoic masses that may represent cystic lesions or solid nodules. The surrounding breast tissue appears otherwise normal, with no evidence of significant disruption to the echogenicity or architecture, suggesting that the masses are likely isolated findings. There are no signs of associated lymphadenopathy or vascular invasion visible on this examination, which may indicate a benign process; however, further evaluation is necessary for conclusive determination.
