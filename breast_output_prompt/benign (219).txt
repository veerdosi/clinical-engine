The ultrasound image displays a distinct hypoechoic mass within the breast parenchyma, characterized by its irregular borders and the absence of acoustic enhancement. Surrounding the lesion, there are signs of increased echogenicity in the adjacent tissue, suggesting possible edema or inflammatory changes. There may also be indications of distortion in the normal architecture of the breast tissue, raising suspicion for a potential neoplastic process.
