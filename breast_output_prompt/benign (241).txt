The ultrasound image demonstrates an irregular hypoechoic mass situated in the breast tissue, positioned approximately 12 mm above the nipple, as indicated on the image. The lesion exhibits features suggestive of abnormality, potentially indicative of a cyst or a solid mass, which may warrant further evaluation. There is noticeable disruption of the surrounding echogenic tissue patterns, suggesting possible infiltration or invasion by the underlying pathology.
