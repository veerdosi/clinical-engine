The ultrasound image presents an anechoic structure noted within the breast tissue, consistent with the presence of a cyst. Surrounding the cyst, there are hyperechoic areas, which may indicate the presence of surrounding tissue edema or fibrosis. Additionally, the lack of internal echoes within the cyst suggests that it is likely a simple cyst rather than a complex or hemorrhagic one.
