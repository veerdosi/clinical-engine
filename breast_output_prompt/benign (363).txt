The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion located in the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. The lesion exhibits irregular margins and demonstrates posterior acoustic shadowing, which may suggest the presence of a solid mass, potentially indicating a carcinoma. Surrounding fibroglandular tissue is observable, with no significant edema or skin thickening noted in the adjacent areas.
