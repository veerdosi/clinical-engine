The ultrasound image demonstrates an irregular hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by its heterogeneous internal echogenicity and distinct margins. Notably, there is a prominent anechoic area suggestive of a cystic component, which may indicate the presence of a complex breast lesion. Surrounding interstitial edema appears to be present, potentially reflecting an inflammatory process or associated changes in the local breast architecture.
