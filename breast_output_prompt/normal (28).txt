The ultrasound image depicts an irregular hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, characterized by its indistinct margins and heterogeneous echo pattern, suggesting potential malignancy. There is noticeable posterior acoustic enhancement, which may indicate the presence of a cystic component or intralesional fluid. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma exhibits signs of architectural distortion, warranting further evaluation for possible associated lymphadenopathy or infiltrative disease.
