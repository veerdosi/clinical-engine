The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion, which appears to exhibit a well-defined margin. Notably, there are areas of acoustic shadowing observed, suggesting the presence of a solid mass, potentially indicative of a benign or malignant process. Surrounding the lesion, there is an echogenic halo that may point towards the surrounding tissue's reaction to the mass, which warrants further evaluation.
