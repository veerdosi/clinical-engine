The ultrasound image depicts an anechoic lesion with well-defined margins located within the breast tissue, suggesting a fluid-filled structure, such as a cyst. There is a notable surrounding echogenicity, which may indicate the presence of adjacent soft tissue edema or inflammation. Additional features, such as the absence of internal echoes, may support the diagnosis of a simple breast cyst, warranting further evaluation for any potential complications.
