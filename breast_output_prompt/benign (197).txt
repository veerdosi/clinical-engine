The ultrasound image reveals an irregularly shaped hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 1.5 cm. This lesion demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement, which may indicate the presence of a cyst or a solid mass. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma appears distorted, suggesting potential associated inflammatory changes or a benign condition such as a fibroadenoma, warranting further investigation.
