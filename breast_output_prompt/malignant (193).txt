The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. The lesion exhibits irregular margins and a posterior acoustic shadowing, which raises suspicion for invasive pathology. Additionally, surrounding parenchymal alterations are noted, suggestive of possible inflammatory changes or neoplasm involvement.
