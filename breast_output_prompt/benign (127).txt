The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass, which suggests the presence of a potential cystic formation. Surrounding this mass, there are notable irregularities in tissue texture and echogenicity, indicating possible infiltration or a complex lesion. Additionally, there is a significant anechoic area, which may suggest the presence of fluid accumulation, warranting further examination for potential underlying pathology such as infection or malignancy.
