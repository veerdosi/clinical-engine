The ultrasound image reveals a hypoechoic cystic lesion characterized by a well-defined anechoic area with posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of a simple cyst. Surrounding the cyst, there are heterogeneous echogenic areas that may indicate potential vascularity or infiltrative changes, warranting further evaluation. There is a notable absence of significant solid components within the lesion, which helps differentiate it from possible malignant or complex breast masses.
