The ultrasound image reveals an irregularly shaped hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2 cm in its longest dimension. Surrounding this abnormality, there appears to be a heterogeneous echo pattern, which may suggest the presence of nearby fibroglandular tissue or potential inflammatory changes. There is no evident posterior acoustic enhancement or shadowing, indicating that the lesion may require further diagnostic evaluation to characterize the nature and potential pathology involved.
