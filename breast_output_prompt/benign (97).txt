The ultrasound image displays a largely hypoechoic lesion in the breast tissue, characterized by a well-defined margin. The lesion measures approximately 2 cm in its longest axis, indicating potential abnormality, which could suggest a cystic or solid mass. Surrounding the lesion, there may be accompanying echogenicity changes in the adjacent breast tissue, which might reflect edema or pathological alterations.
