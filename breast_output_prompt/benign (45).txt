The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic, anechoic area consistent with a cystic lesion, characterized by a distinct boundary and acoustic enhancement posteriorly. There is no evident internal echoes or solid components observed within the lesion, suggesting it may be a simple cyst. Surrounding breast tissue appears unremarkable without any associated architectural distortion or suspicious masses.
