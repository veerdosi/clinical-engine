The ultrasound image displays an anechoic circular lesion within the breast tissue, suggestive of a cyst. The lesionâ€™s margins appear well-defined, and there is no notable internal echogenicity, further indicating it is likely a simple cyst. Surrounding breast tissue exhibits normal echogenicity without any signs of irregularities or associated mass lesions.
