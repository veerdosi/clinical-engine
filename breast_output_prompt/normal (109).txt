The ultrasound image displays heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of fibroglandular tissue interspersed with fatty areas. Notable is the presence of a well-defined hypoechoic lesion that could represent a cyst, possible fibroadenoma, or other masses warranting further evaluation. Surrounding edema is observed, which may indicate underlying inflammatory changes or reactive alterations in the adjacent breast tissue.
