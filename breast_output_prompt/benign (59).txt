The ultrasound image displays multiple rounded anechoic structures located within breast tissue, suggestive of cystic lesions. These lesions appear to have well-defined margins and demonstrate posterior acoustic enhancement, indicative of fluid-filled cavities. The presence of these cysts may warrant further evaluation to rule out any associated pathology or changes in the surrounding breast parenchyma.
