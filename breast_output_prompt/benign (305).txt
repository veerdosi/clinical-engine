The ultrasound image displays a delineated area of heteroechoic texture within the breast tissue, suggestive of a possible solid or complex mass. Measurements indicate a sizable lesion, characterized by irregular margins and posterior acoustic enhancement, which may raise suspicion for a pathologic process. Surrounding glandular breast tissue appears relatively normal, with no evident signs of edema or lymphadenopathy depicted in the visualized area.
