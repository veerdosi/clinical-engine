The ultrasound image depicts an irregularly shaped hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, suggesting potential abnormality. Surrounding the lesion, there is a notable echogenic halo, which may indicate some degree of edema or supportive tissue reaction. Additional features such as posterior acoustic enhancement or shadowing can further assist in characterizing the nature of the lesion, raising suspicion for possible malignancy or a complex cystic mass.
