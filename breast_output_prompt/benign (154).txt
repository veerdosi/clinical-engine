The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous mass with a well-defined hypoechoic area, suggestive of a cystic formation. There appears to be acoustic enhancement posterior to the anechoic structure, indicating the presence of fluid within the mass. Surrounding breast tissue shows no signs of edema or significant alteration in echogenicity, but the clinical correlation is necessary to determine the benign or malignant nature of the lesion.
