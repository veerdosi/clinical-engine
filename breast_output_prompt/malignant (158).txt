The ultrasound image depicts an area of heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, suggestive of potential underlying pathology. There is also the presence of a hypoechoic lesion that measures approximately 1.5 cm, which raises concerns for possible benign or malignant processes such as a cyst, fibroadenoma, or carcinoma. Additionally, surrounding the lesion, irregular borders may indicate infiltration into the surrounding adipose tissue, warranting further evaluation and potential biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
