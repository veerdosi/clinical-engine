The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic mass characterized by well-defined margins, suggestive of a potential cystic formation within the breast parenchyma. The acoustic enhancement observed posteriorly indicates that the mass is likely fluid-filled, which is a typical presentation for a benign lesion such as a simple cyst. No signs of internal echogenicity or irregular borders are noted, thus minimizing the suspicion for malignancy; however, further evaluation may be warranted based on clinical correlation.
