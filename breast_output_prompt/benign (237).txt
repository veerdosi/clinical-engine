The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass characterized by irregular borders, indicative of a potential neoplasm within the breast tissue. Measurement markers (1 and 2) suggest a significant diameter, which may warrant further evaluation through biopsy to determine the histological nature of the lesion. Surrounding normal parenchyma appears intact, with no associated lymphadenopathy noted in the axillary region.
