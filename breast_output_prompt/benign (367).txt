The ultrasound image demonstrates a heterogeneous mass within the right upper inner quadrant of the breast, which exhibits irregular margins and variable echogenicity. The presence of hypoechoic regions suggests the possibility of underlying pathology, such as a palpable lesion or cystic structure. Additionally, associated posterior acoustic enhancement may indicate the presence of a fluid-filled component or increased perfusion related to neovascularization.
