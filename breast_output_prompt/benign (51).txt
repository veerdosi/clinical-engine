The ultrasound image depicts an irregularly shaped hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, indicative of a potential neoplastic lesion. Notably, there is a central anechoic area suggesting the presence of necrosis or a cystic component within the lesion. Surrounding the mass, there appears to be increased echogenicity, which may indicate associated edema or inflammatory changes in the adjacent breast parenchyma.
