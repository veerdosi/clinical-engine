The ultrasound image depicts a lesion that is hypoechoic compared to the surrounding breast tissue, suggestive of a potential cyst or solid mass. The dimensions of the lesion are measured, with the cross-sectional markers indicating a size of approximately 1 x 2 cm. The absence of posterior acoustic enhancement may indicate a denser structure, warranting further evaluation to determine the nature of the mass, which may include benign or malignant characteristics.
