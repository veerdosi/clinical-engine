The ultrasound image depicts an area of hypoechoic tissue located within the breast parenchyma, indicative of a cystic lesion. There is a measurement of approximately 1.5 cm, which suggests the presence of a possibly benign or malignant abnormality, necessitating further evaluation. The surrounding echogenicity appears heterogeneous, possibly indicating adjacent changes in the breast tissue architecture.
