The ultrasound image reveals hypoechoic nodular formations within the breast tissue, indicating potential lesions. The surrounding echogenic fatty tissue appears normal in composition, suggesting no immediate signs of significant inflammatory changes or abnormal mass effect. Notably, the presence of irregular margins around the hypoechoic areas raises suspicion for possible malignant transformation; further diagnostic evaluation may be warranted.
