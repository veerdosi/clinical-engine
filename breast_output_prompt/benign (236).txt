The ultrasound image displays the right axilla, revealing heterogeneous echogenicity within the soft tissue structures. Notable is the presence of an ill-defined mass with varying echogenic characteristics, which may indicate lymphadenopathy or potential neoplastic involvement. Adjacent structures, including the axillary vessels, appear to be preserved, with no overt signs of vascular invasion or adjacent soft tissue edema evident in the visual field.
