The ultrasound image depicts an irregular, hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue. There is evidence of distortion of the surrounding echogenic fat, and the structure demonstrates indistinct margins, which could suggest the presence of a malignant process. Additionally, posterior acoustic enhancement is noted, indicating increased sound transmission through the lesion, further warranting clinical correlation and possible biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
