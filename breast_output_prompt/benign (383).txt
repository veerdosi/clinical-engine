The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous, hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular, scalloped margins. Surrounding the mass, there is evidence of tissue distortion, with potential mild peri-lesional edema noted. The sonographic features may suggest the possibility of a breast lesion, warranting further investigation to rule out malignancy or benign conditions.
