The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic mass located in the breast tissue, characterized by its irregular margins and internal echoes. Measurements are indicated, suggesting potential dimensions of a lesion that could be concerning for malignancy, specifically a breast neoplasm or cyst. Surrounding structures show normal echogenicity, but the presence of associated architectural distortion further raises suspicion for underlying pathology.
