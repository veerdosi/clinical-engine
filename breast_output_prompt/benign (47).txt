The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion located in the breast tissue, characterized by well-defined margins. The surrounding echogenic stroma indicates the presence of potential edema or inflammatory changes in the adjacent tissue. Additionally, the image reveals an anechoic area consistent with a cyst or abscess, suggesting the need for further evaluation to determine the underlying pathology.
