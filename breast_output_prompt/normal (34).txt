The ultrasound image presents an irregular hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, characterized by indistinct margins and associated echogenic changes in the surrounding stroma. Notably, a central anechoic region suggests the presence of a cystic component, which may indicate a possible necrotic or complicated cyst. These features raise suspicion for a benign or malignant infiltrative process requiring further diagnostic evaluation, such as MRI or biopsy, for definitive characterization.
