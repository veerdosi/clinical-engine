The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined hypoechoic mass located in the breast tissue, noted in the right upper quadrant (RTLO). The lesion demonstrates a smooth contour and measures approximately 2 cm in diameter, which may suggest the presence of a benign entity such as a cyst or a fibroadenoma. Clinical correlation and further imaging, if necessary, may be warranted to assess the characteristics and potential implications of this finding.
