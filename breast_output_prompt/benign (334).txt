The ultrasound image depicts a prominent hypoechoic lesion located in the right upper inner quadrant (RT UIQ) of the breast. This lesion is characterized by irregular margins, which may suggest the possibility of malignancy or other pathological processes. Surrounding tissue appears altered, with a potential increase in echogenicity indicative of associated edema or desmoplastic reaction.
