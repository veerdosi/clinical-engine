The ultrasound image reveals a complex cystic structure located in the breast tissue, characterized by irregular margins and heterogeneous echogenicity. Notably, there is associated posterior acoustic enhancement, which may indicate the presence of fluid within the lesion. These features could suggest a benign process such as a cyst, although differential diagnoses may include neoplastic changes requiring further evaluation.
