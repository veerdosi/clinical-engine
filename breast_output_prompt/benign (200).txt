The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass located in the right upper quadrant (RT UOQ) of the breast. The mass appears to have irregular margins and is measured in multiple dimensions, suggesting a potential abnormality that may warrant further evaluation. The surrounding tissue exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement, which can indicate a fluid-filled structure or a lesion with distinct characteristics relevant to differential diagnoses.
