The ultrasound image depicts an irregular, hypoechoic mass within the breast parenchyma, characterized by an echogenic interface suggesting potential cystic or solid components. Surrounding the mass, there appears to be disruption of the normal architectural patterns, indicating possible infiltration or an inflammatory process. Additionally, the presence of posterior acoustic shadowing may suggest the density of the mass, warranting further investigation for benign or malignant processes.
