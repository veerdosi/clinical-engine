The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, which exhibits irregular borders and an associated acoustic shadowing. The lesion measures approximately 1.5 cm in diameter and is potentially indicative of a cystic or solid mass, warranting further evaluation. Additionally, surrounding echogenic breast tissue appears to show some degree of distortion, which could suggest a localized inflammatory process or an early stage of scarring.
