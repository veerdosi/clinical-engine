The ultrasound image demonstrates a significant anechoic structure, indicative of a cystic lesion. The lesion exhibits well-defined margins with acoustic enhancement posteriorly, suggesting a benign nature. Additionally, the surrounding tissue appears normal, with no evidence of vascularity or irregularity in the walls of the lesion, thereby reducing the suspicion for malignancy.
