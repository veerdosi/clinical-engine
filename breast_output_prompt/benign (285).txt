The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass located within the breast parenchyma, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter, as indicated by the crosshairs. This lesion exhibits irregular margins and a heterogeneous internal echo pattern, suggesting possible malignancy or complex cyst formation. Surrounding tissue morphology appears intact, with no significant lymphadenopathy observed in the axillary region.
