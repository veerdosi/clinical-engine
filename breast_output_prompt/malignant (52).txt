The ultrasound image presents a heterogeneous mass within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular contours and varying echogenicity indicative of potential malignancy. Notably, a complex cystic component is observed, which could suggest the presence of a phyllodes tumor or a complicated cyst that may require further evaluation. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma exhibits architectural distortion and possible edema, raising concerns for an underlying pathological process such as invasive carcinoma.
