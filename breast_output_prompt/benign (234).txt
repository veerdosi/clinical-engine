The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, measured at approximately 1.5 cm in the longest dimension. The lesion exhibits irregular margins and displays internal vascularity on Doppler evaluation, suggesting potential malignancy. Surrounding the mass, there is evidence of edema, which may indicate an inflammatory response or desmoplastic reaction associated with the lesion.
