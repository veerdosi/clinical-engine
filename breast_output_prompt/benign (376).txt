The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, demonstrating well-defined margins. There is an area of distortion in the surrounding echogenic breast parenchyma, suggesting the presence of a possible cyst or solid lesion. The characteristics of the mass raise the suspicion for an intra-ductal process, which may warrant further evaluation through additional imaging or biopsy.
