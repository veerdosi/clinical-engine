The ultrasound image shows a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in diameter. The surrounding parenchyma presents with localized architectural distortion and associated shadowing, indicating possible infiltration of the mass. Additionally, there is a notable distinction in echogenicity when compared to the adjacent normal breast tissue, raising suspicion for malignancy.
