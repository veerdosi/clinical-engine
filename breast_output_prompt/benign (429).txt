The ultrasound image displays a complex cystic lesion characterized by an anechoic area with posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of fluid-filled structures. Within the lesion, there appears to be internal echogenic debris, potentially indicative of hemorrhage or necrotic tissue. Additionally, there is irregularity in the surrounding soft tissue, which may raise concern for inflammatory changes or an underlying neoplastic process.
