The ultrasound image displays a mass within the breast tissue, characterized by isoechoic to hypoechoic areas surrounded by echogenic stroma. The noted lesion exhibits irregular borders, which may suggest an infiltrative process or malignancy. Additionally, the presence of posterior acoustic enhancement points to a fluid-filled structure, raising the possibility of a cystic lesion or abscess.

The measurement markers indicate the size of the lesion, which is essential for assessing growth or potential changes over time. Surrounding breast tissue appears normal, without signs of edema or associated lymphadenopathy. Further evaluation with biopsy may be warranted to determine the nature of the identified abnormality.
