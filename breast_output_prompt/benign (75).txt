The ultrasound image demonstrates a well-defined anechoic cystic structure located within the breast tissue, characterized by smooth, thin walls and posterior acoustic enhancement. The surrounding parenchyma appears heterogenous, which may suggest the presence of fibroglandular tissue. No signs of hypervascularity or internal echoes are observed within the cyst, indicating a likely simple cyst without any suspicious features.
