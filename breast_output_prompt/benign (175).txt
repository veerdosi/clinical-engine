The ultrasound image demonstrates an anechoic fluid-filled structure within the breast tissue, suggestive of a cyst. The cyst appears well-defined with smooth, thin walls, and there is no surrounding solid mass, indicating it is likely benign. There is no evidence of internal echoes, debris, or septations within the cyst, which further supports a simple cyst diagnosis rather than a complex or concerning lesion.
