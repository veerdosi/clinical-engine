This ultrasound image of the breast demonstrates heterogeneous echogenicity with multiple echo-rich and echo-poor lesions suggesting the presence of possible cysts or solid masses. The irregular margins of the lesions may indicate potential malignancy, necessitating further evaluation. Additionally, there is distortion of the surrounding parenchyma, which raises concern for infiltrative pathology such as ductal carcinoma.
