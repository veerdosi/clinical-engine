The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion situated posterior to the glandular tissue of the breast, suggestive of a possible cyst or solid mass. The echogenicity of the surrounding breast tissue appears normal, but the lesion demonstrates poorly defined margins which may indicate a higher likelihood of malignancy. Additionally, the presence of internal septations within the lesion could warrant further evaluation to assess for potential complex characteristics, which are often associated with various breast pathologies.
