The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 5.2 cm in the largest dimension. The borders of the lesion appear irregular, with echogenicity suggesting the presence of complex internal structures, which may indicate potential malignancy. A differential diagnosis may include conditions such as a breast abscess, malignant tumor, or fibroepithelial lesion, necessitating further evaluation through diagnostic mammography or biopsy for definitive characterization.
