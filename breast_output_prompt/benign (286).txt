The ultrasound image demonstrates an irregular hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 3 cm in its greatest dimension. The lesion exhibits distinct margins, which may suggest a potential neoplasm, and shows posterior acoustic enhancement, indicative of a fluid-filled or cystic nature. Surrounding tissue appears normal, with no obvious signs of lymphadenopathy or significant edema in the adjacent area.
