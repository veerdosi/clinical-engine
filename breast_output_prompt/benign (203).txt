The ultrasound image reveals a well-defined, oval-shaped hypoechoic lesion situated within the breast tissue, potentially indicating a cyst. The lesion demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement, suggesting fluid content. There is an absence of internal vascularity on Doppler imaging, consistent with a benign etiology, although further evaluation may be warranted based on clinical correlation.
