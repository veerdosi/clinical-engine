The ultrasound image depicts an irregular hypoechoic lesion in the breast tissue, characterized by heterogeneous internal echoes. Notably, an anechoic area with acoustic enhancement is observed, suggesting the presence of a cystic structure adjacent to the mass. The peripheral characteristics of the lesion, including possible increased vascularity, warrant further investigation for potential malignant processes.
