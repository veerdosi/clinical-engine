The image depicts a breast ultrasound, revealing heterogeneous echotexture with areas of increased hypoechogenicity. Notable is a well-defined hypoechoic mass, which may suggest the presence of a benign lesion, such as a fibroadenoma, or potentially a malignant entity depending on further imaging and clinical correlation. Additionally, the surrounding glandular tissue appears structurally normal, with no obvious signs of edema or lymphadenopathy present in the related axillary region.
