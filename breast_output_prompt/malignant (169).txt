The ultrasound image presents a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass located within the breast parenchyma, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in its largest dimension. This lesion exhibits irregular margins and a complex internal architecture, suggesting the possibility of malignancy, such as invasive breast carcinoma. The surrounding tissue appears normal without notable lymphadenopathy or significant edema, indicating the need for further evaluation through biopsy to ascertain the nature of the mass.
