The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular borders and a non-circumscribed appearance. There is notable posterior acoustic enhancement, which suggests that the lesion may be fluid-filled, potentially indicating the presence of a cyst or abscess. Additionally, surrounding echogenicity may indicate associated edema or inflammatory changes in the adjacent breast parenchyma.
