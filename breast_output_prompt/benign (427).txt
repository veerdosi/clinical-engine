The ultrasound image depicts a complex breast lesion characterized by multiple anechoic and hypoechoic areas, suggestive of fluid-filled cysts. Notable is the presence of irregular margins surrounding the lesion, which may indicate potential malignancy or a complicated cystic structure. The measurement indicators (labeled as 1 and 2) suggest an increased size or volume of the lesion, warranting further evaluation to rule out any associated pathologies.
