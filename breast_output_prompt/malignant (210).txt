The ultrasound image presents an area of heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, characterized by a well-defined hypoechoic mass. The mass demonstrates irregular borders and evidence of posterior acoustic shadowing, which raises suspicion for a potential malignancy. Surrounding tissue appears normal; however, the presence of microcalcifications may indicate an underlying pathology that requires further evaluation.
