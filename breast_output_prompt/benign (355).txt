The ultrasound image reveals a well-defined, hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue. The mass appears to have a smooth contour but exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement, characteristic of a cystic lesion. Surrounding tissue demonstrates intact echogenic striations, suggesting the presence of adjacent fatty or glandular tissue without signs of infiltrative changes.
