The ultrasound image displays a rounded, hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.1 cm in its widest dimension, as indicated by the markings. The lesion exhibits well-defined margins, which may suggest the presence of a benign process, such as a cyst or fibroadenoma. Additionally, there are echogenic linear structures adjacent to the lesion, potentially indicative of underlying glandular or adipose tissue interactions.
