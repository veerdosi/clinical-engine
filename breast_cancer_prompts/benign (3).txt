The ultrasound image of the right breast shows an anechoic hypoechoic lesion with well-defined margins, indicative of a cyst. The presence of posterior echogenic enhancement suggests the lesion is fluid-filled, which is characteristic of simple cysts. There is no evidence of associated irregularities or suspicious features, such as increased vascularity or solid components, that would raise concern for malignancy.
