The ultrasound image of the right breast reveals a heterogeneous echotexture, which may indicate the presence of fibroglandular tissue. Additionally, there are areas suggestive of potential masses or lesions that could be evaluated for characteristics such as borders, echogenicity, and posterior acoustic features. No definitive cystic structures are identified, but the overall pattern warrants further assessment for potential abnormalities, including but not limited to benign or malignant lesions.
