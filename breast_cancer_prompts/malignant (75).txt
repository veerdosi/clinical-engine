The ultrasound image exhibits a well-defined hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of a potential cyst or solid lesion. The morphology of the lesion appears to be irregular, with acoustic enhancement observed posteriorly, which could indicate a benign process such as a fibroadenoma or a complex cyst. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma demonstrates normal echogenicity without any signs of significant necrosis or lymphadenopathy.
