The ultrasound image presents an irregularly shaped hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, exhibiting posterior acoustic enhancement. The margins of the lesion appear indistinct, raising suspicion for potential pathological changes such as a neoplastic process. In addition, the surrounding parenchyma demonstrates areas of architectural distortion, which may indicate underlying fibrosis or retraction associated with a chronic inflammatory response.
