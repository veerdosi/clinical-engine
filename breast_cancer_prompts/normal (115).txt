The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular margins and heterogeneous echotexture. Notable posterior acoustic enhancement suggests the presence of a fluid component, which may indicate the possibility of a cystic lesion or neoplastic growth. Increased vascularity as evidenced by Doppler flowmetry could further suggest potential malignancy or inflammatory processes.
