The ultrasound image of the right breast demonstrates a notable hypoechoic area with irregular borders, suggestive of a potential mass lesion. Additionally, there is a well-defined anechoic structure that may represent a cyst or necrotic component within the breast tissue. This finding warrants further evaluation to rule out possible malignancy or other pathological conditions, including fibrocystic changes or abscess formation.
