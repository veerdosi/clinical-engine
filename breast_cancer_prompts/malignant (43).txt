The ultrasound image displays an area of heterogeneous echogenicity within the mammary gland, suggestive of a potential focal lesion. There are irregular borders surrounding the hypoechoic regions, which may represent a cyst or solid mass that warrants further evaluation. Doppler assessment may reveal vascularity, providing additional insight into the nature of the lesion, which could indicate a benign or malignant process.
