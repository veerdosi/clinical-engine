The ultrasound image presents a distinctly hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, characterized by well-defined margins. The measured dimensions of the lesion, indicated by the markings, suggest a possible cystic structure or mass that warrants further investigation. Additionally, the posterior acoustic enhancement observed may indicate the presence of fluid within the lesion, which could be suggestive of a benign pathology, such as a simple breast cyst.
