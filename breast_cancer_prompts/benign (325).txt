The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic lesion with an irregular margin, which is suggestive of potential malignancy. There is a notable posterior acoustic enhancement, indicative of a cystic component. Surrounding tissue appears to be exhibiting increased echogenicity, raising concerns for potential infiltrative changes associated with a neoplastic process.
