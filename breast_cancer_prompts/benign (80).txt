The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined, anechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, consistent with the appearance of a cyst. The cyst demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement, which indicates that it is fluid-filled rather than solid. No internal echoes or solid components are observed, suggesting the absence of complex features typically associated with more suspicious lesions.
