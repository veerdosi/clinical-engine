The ultrasound image displays heterogeneous breast tissue with areas of echogenicity variation, suggestive of potential fibrocystic changes. There are notable echoes consistent with cystic structures or possible fibroadenomas, which can present with a complex appearance on ultrasound. Additionally, the deep margins appear well-defined, indicating that no significant infiltrative mass is evident at this level, but further characterization may be warranted based on clinical evaluation.
