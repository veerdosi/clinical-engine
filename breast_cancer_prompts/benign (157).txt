The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined hypoechoic structure, consistent with a cystic formation within the breast tissue. The anechoic area shows a clear thin echogenic wall, indicating a likely benign cyst, with no associated abnormal surrounding tissue changes. Additionally, the absence of solid components or internal debris suggests a simple cyst, which is common and often asymptomatic in breast imaging.
