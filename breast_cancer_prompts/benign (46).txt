The ultrasound image depicts a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic lesion located in the right breast (RT 12 C). The lesion measures approximately 1 cm in diameter and exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement, suggesting it may be a fluid-filled structure, such as a cyst. Adjacent tissue appears unremarkable, with no significant changes noted in the surrounding parenchyma, indicating the absence of infiltrative disease processes.
