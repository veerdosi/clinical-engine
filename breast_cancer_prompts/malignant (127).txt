The ultrasound image displays a well-defined, anechoic structure consistent with a cystic lesion in the breast tissue. The measurement reflects a significant size, suggesting potential pathological relevance, as cystic lesions can vary from benign to more concerning entities. There are also heterogeneous echoes in the surrounding parenchyma, which could indicate underlying changes that may be attributed to inflammatory or fibrocystic conditions.
