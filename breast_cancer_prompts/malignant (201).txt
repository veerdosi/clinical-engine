The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by an irregular contour and echogenicity. This mass may suggest the presence of a potential neoplastic process, with differential considerations including a fibroadenoma, cyst, or malignant lesion depending on its morphology and surrounding structures. Additionally, there is notable retraction and disruption of surrounding parenchymal architecture, which can be indicative of associated inflammatory changes or invasive pathology.
