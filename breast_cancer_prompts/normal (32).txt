The ultrasound image displays an echogenic lesion within breast tissue, exhibiting irregular borders and calibration that may suggest the potential presence of malignancy. There is also increased vascularity surrounding the lesion, indicative of possible inflammatory changes within the adjacent stroma. The surrounding parenchyma appears hypoechoic, and the overall structure shows signs of distortion, which could be associated with local pathological processes such as infiltrative ductal carcinoma.
