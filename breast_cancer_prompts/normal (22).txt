The ultrasound image displays heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of either benign or malignant lesions. Notable are the irregular hypoechoic areas surrounded by echogenic stroma, which may indicate the potential for a neoplastic process or infiltrative disease. Additionally, the presence of posterior acoustic enhancement suggests cystic components, possibly indicative of a complex mass that warrants further evaluation.
