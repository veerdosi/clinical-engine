The ultrasound image displays a complex mass within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular margins and heterogeneous echogenicity, suggestive of potential malignancy. There is also an associated hypoechoic region surrounding the mass, indicating possible necrosis or fluid collection. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma appears distorted, which may indicate an infiltrative process or reactive changes due to the lesion.
