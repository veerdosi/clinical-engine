The ultrasound image reveals a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, which appears to have irregular margins. There is an anechoic area centrally within the hypoechoic mass, suggestive of a possible cystic component. Surrounding the lesion, echogenic surrounding tissue may indicate a reaction consistent with edema or inflammatory changes.
