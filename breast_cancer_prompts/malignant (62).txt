The ultrasound image presents a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in its greatest dimension. Surrounding the mass, there is evidence of echogenicity changes and shadowing, suggesting possible desmoplastic reaction or associated edema. The characteristics observed may be indicative of a neoplastic process, warranting further investigation and correlation with clinical findings.
