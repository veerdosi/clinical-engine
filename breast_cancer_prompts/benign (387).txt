The ultrasound image presents two distinct hypoechoic masses within the breast tissue. The primary mass exhibits a well-defined, rounded contour, suggestive of a potentially benign lesion, while the secondary mass appears to be smaller and may represent a lymph node or another lesion that requires further evaluation. Surrounding echogenic changes in the breast stroma may indicate a reactionary process, necessitating correlation with clinical findings and possible biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
