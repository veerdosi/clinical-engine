The ultrasound image reveals two anechoic cystic structures with well-defined margins, indicative of simple cysts within the breast parenchyma. Surrounding the cysts, there is a hypoechoic rim that may suggest mild edema or inflammatory changes in the adjacent tissue. No discernible solid mass or suspicious features are noted, indicating the absence of complex or malignant characteristics in the observed lesions.
