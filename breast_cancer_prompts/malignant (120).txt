The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined, anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement, suggesting the presence of a cystic lesion. The margins of the lesion appear smooth, indicating that it may be a benign structure such as a simple breast cyst. There is no evident internal vascularity or solid components within the lesion, which further supports its likely benign nature.
