The ultrasound image reveals an irregularly shaped hypoechoic mass consistent with a potential malignant process. The lesion appears to measure approximately in the dimensions indicated, with marked margins that may suggest an infiltrative nature, warranting further evaluation. Associated features such as posterior acoustic shadowing and disruption of surrounding adipose tissue can be noted, which may raise suspicion for an underlying breast pathology.
