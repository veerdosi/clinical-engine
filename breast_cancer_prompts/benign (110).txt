The ultrasound image depicts an irregularly shaped hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter. Notably, there is an associated area of acoustic shadowing beneath the lesion, which may suggest the presence of solid components or potential necrotic changes. Surrounding breast tissue appears heterogeneous, which may indicate inflammatory response or architectural distortion.
