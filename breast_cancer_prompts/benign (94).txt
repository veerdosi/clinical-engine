The ultrasound image demonstrates a heterogeneous echotexture within the breast tissue, characterized by areas of increased echogenicity interspersed with hypoechoic regions. Notable lesions appear to display undefined margins and heterogeneous internal composition, raising concern for possible neoplastic processes. Additionally, the presence of associated shadowing may suggest the possibility of underlying fibrocystic changes or benign breast conditions such as adenosis.
