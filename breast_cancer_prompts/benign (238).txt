The ultrasound image depicts a well-defined, anechoic lesion located in the right upper quadrant (RT UOQ) of the breast tissue. The lesion measures approximately X by Y cm, indicated by the cross marks, and exhibits a thin, echogenic capsule signifying a potential cystic structure. No internal echoes or solid components are identified within the lesion, suggesting it may represent a simple breast cyst, but further evaluation may be warranted to exclude any underlying pathology.
