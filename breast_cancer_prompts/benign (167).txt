The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by smooth, well-defined margins. The surrounding echogenic stroma may indicate the presence of edema or reactive changes adjacent to the lesion. This appearance is suggestive of a potential cystic formation, possibly indicating a benign condition such as a simple breast cyst or a complex cyst that requires further evaluation.
