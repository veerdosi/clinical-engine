The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular contours and mixed echo patterns. Notably, there are subcutaneous and periductal structures that may suggest the presence of a cystic lesion or possible solid mass, which is indicative of potential pathological changes. Additionally, altered vascularity may be observed, raising suspicion for underlying conditions such as a benign tumor or malignancy, necessitating further evaluation and imaging.
