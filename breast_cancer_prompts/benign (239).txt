The ultrasound image reveals a hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular margins and posterior acoustic shadowing. Measurements indicated by the markings suggest that the mass is approximately 2 cm in size, which may raise suspicion for malignancy or a complex cyst. Additionally, there is associated peri-lesional edema observable within the surrounding parenchyma, indicating potential inflammatory changes or other abnormalities.
