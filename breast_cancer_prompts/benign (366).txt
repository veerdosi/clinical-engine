The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, exhibiting distinct margins and an irregular shape. Notably, the lesion measures approximately 2.5 cm in its largest dimension, as indicated by the measurement markers. The observed features may suggest the presence of a potentially significant pathological condition, such as a breast mass or neoplasm, warranting further evaluation through diagnostic imaging or biopsy for definitive characterization.
