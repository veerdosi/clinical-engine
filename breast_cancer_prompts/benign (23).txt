The ultrasound image presents an irregular, hypoechoic area characterized by a central anechoic region consistent with a cystic lesion. Surrounding the anechoic structure, there are echogenic walls, which may suggest a possible inflammatory process or the presence of debris within the cyst. The absence of posterior enhancement and the overall morphology could indicate the presence of a complicated cyst, warranting further clinical evaluation to rule out any malignancy or other abnormalities.
