The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic lesion characterized by irregular borders, suggesting the possibility of a fibroadenoma or other solid breast mass. Surrounding echogenic stroma suggests associated changes potentially indicative of inflammation or cystic involvement. Further evaluation with Doppler imaging may be warranted to assess vascularity and aid in elucidating the nature of the lesion.
