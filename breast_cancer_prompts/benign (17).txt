The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, characterized by a circular morphology with well-defined margins. The surrounding parenchyma shows echogenicity patterns suggestive of potential reactive changes. There is an absence of notable shadowing, which may indicate the cystic nature of the lesion, although further clinical correlation is warranted to determine its etiology.
