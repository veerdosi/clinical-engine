The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion located in the right upper quadrant of the breast, suggesting a cystic formation. The margins of the lesion appear well-defined, indicating that it may be a benign process, such as a simple cyst or a fibroadenoma. There is no evidence of increased vascularity or irregular borders, which often correlate with malignant characteristics.
