The ultrasound image of the right breast (labeled "RT") reveals a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with irregular margins, suggesting the possibility of malignancy. There is associated posterior acoustic shadowing, which is commonly indicative of denser tissue or potential infiltration of nearby structures. Additionally, the measurement marker indicates the size of the lesion, which is critical for further clinical assessment and management.
