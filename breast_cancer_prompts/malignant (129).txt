The ultrasound image depicts a heterogeneous mass within the breast tissue characterized by irregular margins and a complex echo pattern. The lesion measures approximately 3.2 cm in its longest dimension, and it displays hypoechoic areas, suggestive of possible cystic components or necrotic tissue. There is also associated acoustic shadowing, which may indicate the presence of irregular calcifications or possible surrounding edema, warranting further diagnostic evaluation.
