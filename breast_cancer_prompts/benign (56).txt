The ultrasound image depicts two large, well-defined anechoic cystic structures located within the breast parenchyma, indicative of complex cysts. The surrounding echogenic tissue displays some heterogeneity, which may suggest adjacent inflammatory changes or fibroglandular tissue. The bilaterality and morphology of these cysts warrant further evaluation to rule out potential pathology such as fibroadenomas or other complex lesions.
