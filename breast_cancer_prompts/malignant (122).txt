The ultrasound image presents a well-defined, hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2 cm in its largest dimension. The mass exhibits irregular margins and demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement, features that warrant further evaluation for potential malignancy. Surrounding tissue appears normal, with no significant lymphadenopathy observed in the axillary region.
