The ultrasound image displays bilateral echogenic areas with heterogeneous echotexture, suggestive of the presence of benign or potentially malignant breast lesions. Notable hypoechoic regions are observed, which could represent cysts or solid masses, warranting further evaluation for characteristics such as shape, margins, and posterior acoustic features. Additional findings include thickened skin or increased vascularity, which may indicate inflammation or other pathological processes in the breast tissue.
