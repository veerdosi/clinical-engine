The ultrasound image displays an irregularly shaped, hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by heterogenous echogenicity. There is evidence of surrounding edema, suggesting inflammatory changes, and the presence of posterior acoustic enhancement indicates a cystic component, potentially indicative of a complex lesion. Additionally, the architecture of the surrounding parenchyma appears distorted, raising concern for possible infiltrative disease, such as malignancy or advanced fibroadenoma.
