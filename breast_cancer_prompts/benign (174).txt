The ultrasound image demonstrates a well-defined, hypoechoic round mass within the breast tissue, indicative of a possible cyst or solid lesion. The posterior acoustic enhancement suggests that the lesion is likely a simple cyst, characterized by a fluid-filled anechoic structure. Surrounding breast tissue appears unremarkable without signs of infiltrative disease or lymphadenopathy.
