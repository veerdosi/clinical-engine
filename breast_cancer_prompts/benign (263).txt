The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic lesion within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular borders and possible posterior acoustic enhancement. Measurement markers are indicated, with the lesion showing dimensions consistent with a solid mass, warranting further evaluation for potential malignancy. The presence of surrounding edema or cortical thickening may suggest an inflammatory process or infiltrative pathology associated with the identified lesion.
