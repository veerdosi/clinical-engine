The ultrasound image of the right breast reveals two distinct anechoic structures, which may represent cystic lesions. These cysts exhibit well-defined margins and demonstrate increased echogenicity in the adjacent breast tissue, indicating potential fatty infiltration or fibrosis. Additionally, there are no definitive signs of solid mass formation, microcalcifications, or abnormal vascularity noted in the surrounding parenchyma.
