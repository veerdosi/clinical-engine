The ultrasound image displays multiple well-defined, hypoechoic lesions within the breast tissue, suggestive of cystic formations. These lesions appear with a predominantly anechoic center and a thin, echogenic wall, consistent with simple or complex breast cysts. Additionally, the presence of surrounding echogenic tissue may indicate possible inflammation or reactive changes in the adjacent parenchyma.
