The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion located within the right breast, noted by the measurement markings indicating its dimensions. There is an irregular contour and an associated posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of a cystic structure or potential mass. The surrounding breast tissue appears heterogeneous, and further evaluation may be warranted to assess for characteristics indicative of malignancy or benign pathology.
