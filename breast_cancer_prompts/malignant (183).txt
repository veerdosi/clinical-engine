The ultrasound image demonstrates a conspicuous hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, characterized by well-defined margins. The mass exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of a fluid-filled structure, which may indicate the presence of a cyst or abscess. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma appears echogenic, potentially indicating edema or inflammation in the adjacent breast tissue.
