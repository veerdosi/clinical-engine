The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.5 cm by 1.5 cm as indicated by the annotations. The lesion demonstrates irregular margins and internal echogenic foci, which may suggest the presence of fibrocystic changes or a suspicious mass. There is an absence of posterior acoustic enhancement, indicating potential solid components within the lesion that warrant further clinical investigation.
