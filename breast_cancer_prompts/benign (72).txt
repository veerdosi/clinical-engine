The ultrasound image presents a well-defined, hypoechoic mass with notable posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of a cystic lesion. The round shape and smooth margins of the mass may indicate a benign process, although further evaluation is necessary to rule out complex characteristics. Peri-lesional echogenicity may also suggest the presence of surrounding tissue changes often associated with inflammatory processes or other abnormalities.
