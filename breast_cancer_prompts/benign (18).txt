The ultrasound image reveals multiple well-defined, hypoechoic lesions within the breast tissue, suggestive of potential cyst formation. Each lesion appears to display thin walls, which are characteristic of simple cysts, and they do not exhibit any internal echoes or significant wall thickening. Additionally, the surrounding echogenic breast parenchyma is preserved, indicating a benign nature of the observed abnormalities.
