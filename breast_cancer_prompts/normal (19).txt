The ultrasound image demonstrates the presence of an irregularly shaped hypoechoic mass in the breast tissue, which may indicate a potential neoplastic process. The surrounding echogenic stroma appears disrupted, suggesting possible infiltration into adjacent tissues. Additionally, there is a notable distortion of the normal glandular architecture, raising concerns for a pathology such as invasive carcinoma or a complex cyst.
