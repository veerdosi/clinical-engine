The ultrasound image shows a hypoechoic lesion with an irregular contour, located within the breast tissue. This lesion presents with anechoic characteristics at the center, suggestive of a potential cystic structure or a fluid-filled cavity. The surrounding echogenic areas may indicate adjacent tissue reaction or changes in the stroma, which could warrant further evaluation for potential pathology, including the possibility of a neoplasm or abscess formation.
