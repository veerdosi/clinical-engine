The ultrasound image depicts a rounded, anechoic structure with posterior acoustic enhancement, consistent with a fluid-filled cyst. The surrounding breast tissue appears normal without any hyperemia or signs of edema. There is no evidence of solid components or internal echoes within the cyst, which can suggest a benign nature, although further evaluation may be warranted to rule out more complex cystic or solid lesions.
