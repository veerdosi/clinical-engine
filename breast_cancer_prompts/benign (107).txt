The ultrasound image depicts a hypoechoic lesion located within the breast parenchyma, which measures approximately 2 cm in diameter. There is an observable irregular margin surrounding the lesion, suggesting possible infiltrative characteristics that could be indicative of malignancy. Additionally, there are echogenic foci within the lesion, which may represent microcalcifications, often associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
