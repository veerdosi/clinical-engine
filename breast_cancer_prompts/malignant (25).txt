The ultrasound image presents a round hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, suggestive of a cystic structure. The margins appear well-defined, indicating a possible benign process; however, the internal echo patterns are homogeneous, consistent with fluid content. There is no significant posterior enhancement observed, which may further imply non-solid characteristics typical of a simple cyst.
