The ultrasound image depicts an anechoic area consistent with a cystic structure within the breast tissue, demonstrating well-defined margins. The presence of posterior acoustic enhancement suggests that the lesion is fluid-filled, further supporting the diagnosis of a simple breast cyst. No solid components or suspicious features are observed within the cyst, indicating a benign nature.
