The ultrasound image presents a complex cystic structure within the breast tissue, characterized by irregular margins and heterogeneous echogenicity. The presence of internal echo patterns may suggest potential hemorrhagic changes or debris within the cyst, raising suspicion for an underlying pathology. Surrounding breast tissue appears infiltrated, which could indicate local inflammatory changes or the presence of an infiltrative mass.
