The ultrasound image displays an irregular hypoechoic mass within the breast parenchyma, exhibiting shadowing posteriorly. The margins of the lesion appear indistinct, which raises suspicion for malignancy. Additionally, associated changes in the surrounding tissue, such as edematous alteration and increased vascularity, may indicate inflammatory or neoplastic processes.
