The ultrasound image demonstrates an anechoic or hypoechoic mass located in the right axilla, with a well-defined margin. Three distinct measuring points are indicated, suggesting quantification of the lesion's size and morphology. This finding may be indicative of a potential lymphadenopathy or a cystic structure, warranting further evaluation to determine the nature of the lesion.
