The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous echogenic mass in the breast parenchyma, displaying irregular margins that may suggest the presence of an infiltrative process. There is an apparent shadowing effect, indicative of possible fibroglandular tissue distortion or a dense, underlying structure. Additionally, the presence of surrounding acoustic changes may suggest inflammatory or neoplastic activity warranting further evaluation through biopsy or additional imaging modalities.
