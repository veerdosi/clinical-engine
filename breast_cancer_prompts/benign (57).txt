The ultrasound image depicts a complex cystic structure in the breast tissue, exhibiting an anechoic appearance with well-defined margins. There is potential for a heterogeneous internal echo pattern, suggesting the possibility of debris or hemorrhage within the cystic space. The surrounding breast parenchyma appears echogenic, which may indicate inflammation or a reactive change associated with the cystic lesion.
