The ultrasound image reveals a hypoechoic mass surrounded by echogenic tissue, indicating a potential lesion. The characteristics observed, including irregular borders and posterior acoustic enhancement, may suggest a fibroadenoma or possibly a malignant process. Additional evaluation may be warranted to further assess the morphology and vascularity of the lesion, considering its clinical significance.
