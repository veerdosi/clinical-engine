The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic mass located in the breast tissue, characterized by irregular borders and posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of a lesion. The measurement is indicated within the image, displaying dimensions that may correspond to a notable entity, potentially representing a cystic or solid tumor. Surrounding the mass, the echogenicity appears heterogeneous, which may indicate the presence of edema or surrounding fibroglandular tissue changes.
