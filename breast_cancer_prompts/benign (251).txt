The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion in the right breast, denoted as "rt3," which may suggest the presence of a potential abnormality. The lesion measures approximately t2 in width and t3 in height, with distinct echogenic margins that may indicate a differential diagnosis of a cystic or solid mass. Additionally, the surrounding breast tissue appears homogeneous without signs of increased vascularity, which could provide further insights into the characterization of the lesion.
