The ultrasound image demonstrates a hypoechoic lesion within the right breast tissue, marked "RT8." The lesion displays irregular margins and heterogeneous internal echoes, suggesting a potential cystic or solid mass. Notable acoustic enhancement is seen posterior to the lesion, which may indicate fluid content or increased vascularity associated with neoplastic growth.
