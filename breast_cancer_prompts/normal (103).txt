The ultrasound image displays a heterogeneous echogenicity within the breast tissue, indicating the presence of multiple cystic structures. Such findings may suggest the occurrence of a fibroadenoma or a complex cyst, characterized by irregular margins and varying internal echoes. Additionally, the presence of posterior acoustic enhancement can be noted, which is often associated with fluid-filled lesions or benign entities in breast imaging.
