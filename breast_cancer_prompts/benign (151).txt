The ultrasound image presents a prominent echogenic lesion within the breast tissue, appearing with distinct margins that raise suspicion for a solid mass. The surrounding hypoechoic area may indicate associated edema or a reactive change in the adjacent breast parenchyma. Further evaluation with additional imaging or biopsy may be warranted to characterize the nature of the lesion and assess for potential malignancy.
