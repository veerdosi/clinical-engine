The ultrasound image depicts a distinct hypoechoic lesion located within the breast parenchyma, demonstrating irregular margins. The presence of posterior shadowing suggests a denser structure, which may raise suspicion for a potential malignancy or complication such as a cyst or fibroepithelial lesion. Accompanied by surrounding echogenicity changes, these characteristics warrant further evaluation, possibly through biopsy or additional imaging studies.
