The ultrasound image displays two anechoic lesions within the breast tissue, indicative of cystic formations. The larger lesion measures approximately 2.4 cm, while the smaller lesion appears to be of lesser diameter, signaling potential benign cysts. The surrounding tissue appears homogeneous with no evident signs of irregular margins or associated solid components, suggesting that these lesions may be consistent with simple cysts rather than complex or malignant masses.
