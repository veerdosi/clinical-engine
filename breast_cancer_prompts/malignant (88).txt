The ultrasound image depicts an irregularly shaped, hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, exhibiting distinct margins. The presence of posterior acoustic shadowing suggests possible fibroglandular tissue or lesion involvement, indicating a potential neoplastic condition. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma appears heterogenous, raising suspicion for associated structural abnormalities or inflammatory changes.
