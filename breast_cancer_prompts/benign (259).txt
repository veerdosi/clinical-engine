The ultrasound image demonstrates an anechoic cystic structure located in the right lower quadrant of the breast, exhibiting well-defined edges. The lesion measures approximately 1 cm in diameter, displaying posterior acoustic enhancement, indicating fluid-filled characteristics. No notable solid components or irregular borders are observed, suggesting a benign nature, such as a simple breast cyst, which may require follow-up or monitoring based on clinical presentation.
