The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion located in the right axilla, characterized by distinct borders and posterior acoustic enhancement, which may suggest a cystic or solid mass formation. The dimensions of the lesion are annotated, indicating a measurement that likely assists in evaluating potential pathological significance. Surrounding structures, including vascular and soft tissue components, appear preserved, pointing to the necessity for further clinical correlation and possibly diagnostic follow-up concerning the noted anomaly.
