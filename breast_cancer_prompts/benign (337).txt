The ultrasound image displays heterogeneous echogenicity in the breast tissue, indicative of fibroglandular density. There are areas suggestive of complex cystic formations, possibly representing a seroma or an abscess, characterized by anechoic or hypoechoic borders. Additionally, there is evidence of irregular margins, which may raise suspicion for underlying malignancy or invasive pathology, warranting further diagnostic evaluation.
