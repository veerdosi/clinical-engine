The ultrasound image demonstrates an irregular hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, characterized by its distinct boundaries and a heterogeneous internal echo pattern. The mass measures approximately 2 cm, with accompanying posterior acoustic enhancement suggestive of a cystic component or a fibroadenoma. Additionally, there are subtle architectural distortions in the surrounding breast tissue, which may indicate potential infiltrative disease processes such as invasive carcinoma or other neoplastic changes.
