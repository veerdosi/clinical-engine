The ultrasound image demonstrates a heterogeneous mass located in the right upper quadrant (RT UOQ) of the breast, characterized by irregular margins and an echoic halo. The measurements are indicated, suggesting potential dimensions of the lesion, which may raise suspicion for a neoplastic process. The surrounding echogenic tissue appears to be intact, indicating no immediate evidence of invasion into adjacent structures.
