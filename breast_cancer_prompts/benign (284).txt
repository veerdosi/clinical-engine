The ultrasound image reveals a well-defined hypoechoic mass located within the breast parenchyma, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter, as indicated by the annotations. This mass exhibits posterior acoustic enhancement and appears to be irregularly shaped, raising suspicion for a possible neoplastic process. Surrounding breast tissue demonstrates no significant abnormalities, but the presence of this lesion warrants further evaluation for differential diagnosis, including the potential for malignancy.
