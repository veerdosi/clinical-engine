The ultrasound image demonstrates an irregular, hypoechoic mass within the breast tissue, which exhibits poorly defined margins. There is associated disruption of the normal echotexture of the surrounding parenchyma, potentially indicating possible infiltration or neoplastic changes. Additionally, the presence of posterior acoustic enhancement suggests an underlying cystic component within the lesion.
