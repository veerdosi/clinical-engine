The ultrasound image displays a circumscribed anechoic structure, typical of a cyst, located within the breast tissue. The dimensions indicated with calipers suggest the size of the lesion, which presents a well-defined border, indicating that it is likely benign in nature. Surrounding echogenic stroma appears uniform, suggesting no significant infiltration or accompanying abnormalities that might raise suspicion for malignancy.
