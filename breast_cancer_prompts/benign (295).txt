The ultrasound image depicts an anechoic lesion noted in the left lower quadrant (LT LOQ) of the breast, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. The lesion demonstrates smooth, well-defined borders indicative of a cystic structure, with no internal echoes present, suggesting fluid-filled content. There is also an absence of any associated abnormal vascularity or surrounding tissue edema, which may aid in the differential diagnosis.
