The ultrasound image of the right breast demonstrates a well-defined, anechoic cystic structure, measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Acoustic enhancement is noted posterior to the lesion, suggesting that it is a simple cyst without any solid components or complex features. There are no accompanying signs of surrounding edema or abnormal lymphadenopathy, indicating an absence of associated inflammatory changes.
