The ultrasound image reveals an irregularly shaped hypoechoic mass within the breast parenchyma, exhibiting indistinct margins. There is presence of posterior acoustic enhancement, suggesting a cystic component, which may indicate a complex or hemorrhagic cyst. Additional findings include surrounding echogenic stromal changes that may be indicative of associated inflammatory or fibrotic changes within the breast tissue.
