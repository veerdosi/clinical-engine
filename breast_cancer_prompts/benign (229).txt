The ultrasound image demonstrates a rounded anechoic structure located in the right lower quadrant of the breast, indicative of a cyst. The dimensions of the cyst, as indicated by the annotated measurements, suggest a significant size but do not specify the characteristics of the surrounding tissue. No additional internal echoes or Doppler flow signals are noted, which may suggest the absence of vascularity commonly associated with solid lesions or malignancies.
