The ultrasound image shows a well-defined, hypoechoic mass situated within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in its largest dimension, indicated by the markings on the image. The lesion exhibits irregular contours, which may suggest the possibility of malignancy or a benign process such as a complex cyst or fibroadenoma. Additionally, the surrounding echogenicity appears preserved, with no evidence of associated lymphadenopathy or significant edema in the adjacent breast tissue.
