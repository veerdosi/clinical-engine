The ultrasound image demonstrates a well-defined anechoic lesion located in the right upper quadrant (RT UOQ) of the breast. The presence of a peripheral vascular signal on Doppler imaging indicates increased vascularity, which may suggest an underlying pathological process. The characterized shape and echogenicity of the lesion warrant further evaluation to rule out differential diagnoses, including but not limited to a cyst, abscess, or neoplastic process.
