The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of the breast, characterized by well-defined margins. The lesion appears to have a homogenous pattern, suggesting the possibility of a cystic structure or an underlying solid neoplasm. Surrounding tissue shows normal echogenicity, indicating no significant associated edema or architectural distortion at this level.
