The ultrasound image displays a hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, suggesting the presence of a potential lesion. There is evidence of posterior acoustic enhancement associated with the mass, which can indicate a cystic component or a poorly-defined solid lesion. Additionally, the surrounding parenchyma shows echogenicity alteration, raising the possibility of inflammatory changes or infiltration.
