The ultrasound image displays an irregular hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in its largest dimension. The lesion exhibits poorly defined margins and demonstrates internal vascularity, suggesting a possible neoplastic process. Adjacent echogenic structures indicate the presence of surrounding edema, which may be associated with inflammatory changes or other breast pathology.
