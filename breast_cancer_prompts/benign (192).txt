The ultrasound image displays a complex breast lesion characterized by a large, anechoic region consistent with a cystic formation. Surrounding the cystic area, there appears to be heterogeneous echogenicity, which may indicate the presence of adjacent tissue changes such as edema or fibrotic alterations. Additionally, the irregular borders of the lesion raise suspicion for potential loculated processes or malignancy, warranting further evaluation.
