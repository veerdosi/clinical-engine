The ultrasound image presents a well-defined anechoic lesion, suggestive of a fluid-filled cyst within the breast tissue. Surrounding the cyst, there is an increased echogenicity, indicating possible edema or inflammation in the adjacent parenchyma. Notably, the absence of internal echoes within the lesion suggests a simple cyst rather than a complex or solid mass, which would require further evaluation.
