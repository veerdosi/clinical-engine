The ultrasound image displays an anechoic area suggestive of a cystic formation within the breast tissue. The well-defined margins of the lesion indicate a benign nature, while the surrounding echogenic stroma appears normal. The absence of internal echoes within the cystic structure supports the diagnosis of a simple breast cyst, typically characterized by fluid accumulation without associated solid components.
