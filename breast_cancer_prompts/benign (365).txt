The ultrasound image presents a hypoechoic mass within breast tissue, characterized by a well-defined border and a darker appearance compared to the surrounding parenchyma. The presence of posterior acoustic enhancement suggests a fluid-filled structure, which is indicative of a possible cyst. Additional evaluation is warranted to assess for any irregularities in the mass's morphology that may suggest potential malignancy or complex changes.
