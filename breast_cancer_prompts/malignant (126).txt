The ultrasound image displays an irregular hypoechoic mass located within the breast tissue, measuring approximately 2 cm in its greatest diameter. Surrounding the mass, there is evidence of acoustic shadowing, which may suggest denser tissue or the presence of structural changes indicative of pathology. Increased vascularity may also be noted in the surrounding stroma upon color Doppler evaluation, suggesting possible inflammatory or neoplastic processes.
